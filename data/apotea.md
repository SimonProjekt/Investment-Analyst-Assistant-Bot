The prescription for profitable growth – initiating coverage
We initiate coverage of Swedish online pharmacy Apotea at HOLD with a SEK73 target
price. We view Apotea as a gold standard in Nordic online retail thanks to its dominant
position in the Swedish online pharmacy market, and what we consider a great record of
high, non-cyclical growth and self-funded expansion, with profitability from year one.

We forecast a 14.5% sales CAGR(23–27e), close to Apotea's financial target of 2x sales in
4–5 years (15–19% CAGR). This is driven by our expectations of: 1) greater online
penetration fuelling 13% annual online pharmacy market growth in a market historically
resilient to cyclicality; 2) expanding further into consumer staples categories that have a
~SEK50bn TAM (e.g. the beauty category already represents ~25% of non-Rx LTM sales);
and 3) growing Rx sales from its 4% market share today as it ramps up Rx capacity.
Apotea is at the upper end of its 3–5% medium-term EBIT margin target, but we note that
the ongoing investments in its second, highly automated fulfilment centre (Varberg) will
likely burden the margin initially as utilisation ramps up from mid-2025. For the short term,
we also note that Q4(24) is the final quarter with easy margin comparisons, and thus we
expect earnings growth to subside to neutral to slightly down Y/Y in Q2–Q4(25). We
forecast earnings to recover in 2026e and 2027e, with annual EBIT growth of 26–32%.
The shares have risen 38% since the SEK58 IPO price on 6 December, versus the overall
stock market at -4%. Apotea is now trading at EV/EBIT(26e) of 23x, a significant premium
to key Nordic online peers at 12x, but below the much larger and faster growing yet still
loss-making European peer Redcare Pharmacy at 32x. Our target price implies EV/EBIT(26e)
of 21x. We argue a premium valuation to peers is warranted owing to Apotea’s strong track
record of profitable growth, dominant online market position with a long growth runway
remaining, and defensive qualities, with interest-bearing net debt also near zero.

Apotea

Investment case
Near term:
6–12m

We expect good earnings momentum throughout Q4(24)–H1(25). However, the share has had a strong run since its IPO price of SEK58, and for
H2(25) we note potential short-term risks from new regulation regarding online Rx deliveries and the Varberg ramp-up weighing considerably on
the margin. At the same time, the share is trading at a significant premium to online peers, based on EV/EBIT(26e). To balance an appealing longterm story with short/medium-term potential disruptions, we initiate coverage with a HOLD recommendation.

Long term:
5Y+

Apotea targets reaching ~SEK12bn of sales by 2028–29 (implies ~15–19% sales CAGR (from Q3(24)), with long-term EBIT margin increasing to
7–8%. Apotea says it will focus on: 1) maintaining operational excellence; 2) expanding its Rx sales; and 3) growth in Norway. We see potential
for Apotea to grow through gradually improving online penetration and driving further staples categories’ sales through its platform (~SEK50bn
market outside the pharmacy channel, per Arthur D. Little).

3 Key risks
to investment
case:

Capacity: Apotea’s second fulfilment centre (in Varberg) should start ramping up from Q3(25), which will drive additional cost and lower utilisation.
Margin volatility: Apotea’s margin has been volatile historically, partly due to its growth focus. We see risk of continuous margin volatility ahead
e.g. due to price investments and Norwegian operations ramping up.
Regulation: Selling pharmaceuticals implies a highly regulated environment and changes could significantly disrupt Apotea or the market. For
instance, the SMPA has an ongoing matter for a regulatory change set for autumn 2025 restricting deliveries of pharmacy products bought online.

Upside/downside spectrum 12m
Bull price of SEK85: based on Apotea’s financial targets translating into a 15% sales CAGR(24–29e) and
a 7% margin 2029e.
Bear price of SEK34: EV/EBIT(26e) in line with Swedish online retailers based on our EBIT(26e).

Key peers
We compare Apotea to Swedish online retail/D2C peers, with key peers: Boozt, Haypp, Lyko, as well
as European online pharmacy players Redcare Pharmacy and DocMorris.

Company description
Launched in 2012, Apotea has quickly become the leading online pharmacy in Sweden, with a 43% online market share (9% total market) in 2023. It offers lower
prices, a wider assortment, and fast and flexible deliveries compared to its peers, yet the business has essentially been self-funded and has consistently been profitable
since its first year of operation. It currently has one large, automated fulfilment centre in Morgongåva, and is building a second in Varberg that it expects to ramp up
from mid-2025. Apotea also owns parts of online pharmacies in Norway (Apotera) and Finland.

Valuation and methodology
We base our valuation on EV/EBIT(26e), i.e. after the initial margin distortion from the ramp-up of the Varberg fulfilment centre, supported by other multiples for
2026e, such as cash flow multiples (FCF yield) and by a DCF. While the Nordic online sector is trading at NTM multiples well below its history, we consider Apotea
the gold standard and argue that a premium is warranted owing to its dominant position with a long growth runway and defensive qualities.

Apotea

Investment case
We view Apotea as a gold standard in Nordic online retail thanks to its dominant position
in the Swedish online pharmacy market, and what we consider a great record of high,
non-cyclical growth and self-funded expansion, with profitability in year one. We note
that the company has a strong culture of cost control and has invested heavily into
automation, which enables it to keep prices low, and alongside tight regulation creates
significant moats for competition. We initiate coverage with a HOLD recommendation
and a fair value of SEK73, based on EV/EBIT(26e) of 21x, which still represents a clear
premium versus Nordic online peers.

15 January 2025

Apotea is the leading online pharmacy in Sweden, with data from the Swedish Pharmacy Association
showing a 43% online market share in 2023. Launched in 2012, Apotea quickly established itself at the
forefront of the rather underdeveloped online pharmacy market. It offers lower prices, a wider
assortment, and fast and flexible deliveries compared to its peers, yet the business has essentially been
self-funded and has consistently been profitable ever since its first year of operations.
An Arthur D. Little study values the Swedish pharmacy market at around SEK58bn in 2023. It
was re-regulated in 2009, which led to a break-up of the former monopolist and paved the way
for the sale of OTC and later also Rx drugs online. According to SCB, the market grew at a 4.3%
CAGR(00–23), more than 2x average GDP growth (2.1%) in the same period. Online penetration
is around 20%; Apotea is the biggest online player by a wide margin with a 43% online market
share, eight times bigger than its nearest online-only peer, and a 9% share of the total market.
Apotea has what we consider to be a strong track-record of profitable growth and an asset-light
business model which has enabled self-funded growth investments in automated fulfilment. We
pencil in annual sales of SEK9.4bn by 2027, representing a 14.5% CAGR(23–27e), in line with
the online pharmacy market until 2028 as projected by Arthur D. Little, but slightly below the
company target of a 15–19% CAGR for the next 4-5 years. We believe Apotea has a good chance
of reaching its targets as it is the dominant online player with a long growth runway remaining,
especially if OTC/traded goods (TG) TAM outside the Swedish pharmacy channel (SEK51bn,
Arthur D. Little) is included. Apotea expects to achieve this by 1) maintaining operational
excellence; 2) expanding its Rx sales (only 4% market share 2023), and 3) growth in Norway.
Apotea is already in the upper end of its short- to medium-term EBIT margin target of 3–5%, but
we note that the company is investing heavily in its second highly automated fulfilment centre,
located in Varberg, Sweden, with capex of ~SEK350m–380m, building on its previous automation
experience. As utilisation ramps up gradually from mid-2025, it could initially burden the EBIT
margin due to higher D&A, opex and lower utilisation. We expect earnings to recover in 2026e and
2027e with annual EBIT growth of 26–32%. We expect net cash (excl. IFRS 16) of SEK19m in
2025e (Q3(24): SEK2m), as we expect strong cash flows, allowing for self-financed investments.
We believe key risks are related to Apotea’s margin outlook, not least given its historical margin
volatility and the upcoming launch of the Varberg fulfilment centre. Sales of pharmaceutical
products are also subject to regulatory changes, which may at least impact margins but could at
worst hamper sales. Risks related to its part ownership in Norway and Finland should have limited
impact on near-term earnings, but risks could increase if these were to scale-up considerably.
The shares have risen 38% since the 6 December IPO, which is clearly above the overall market.
Our fair value of SEK73 is based on EV/EBIT(26e) 21x, versus the current 23x which implies a
valuation premium of ~100% versus key Nordic online peers at 11.5x, and the overall sector’s
10x. Apotea is trading at a discount to European peer Redcare Pharmacy at 32x EV/EBIT(26e),
which the market likely justifies given Redcare’s much larger TAM and its 25% sales CAGR(23–
26e) (~10%-points above Apotea’s), despite it being loss-making. However, based on EV/S(26e)
Apotea trades at a ~55% premium to Redcare. While the Nordic online sector is trading at NTM
multiples well below its history, we consider Apotea the gold standard and argue a premium is
warranted owing to its dominant position with a long growth runway and defensive qualities.

Apotea

Q4(24) preview – continued growth momentum
Apotea will report its first quarterly results since its IPO on 6 February. We expect a
strong Q4(24) report, continuing to show good sales momentum of 12% Y/Y supported
by our channel checks. We also estimate strong adj. EBIT growth of 54% Y/Y, adjusted
for SEK16m in expected listing costs. We expect healthy underlying FCF for Q4(24),
albeit hampered by significant expansion capex, resulting in a small net cash position
(excl. IFRS 16) for 2024e. However, we note that Q4(24) represents the final quarter with
easy comparisons against relatively low EBIT margins, and we expect earnings growth
to slow to neutral to slightly down in Q2–Q4(25), owing mostly to the Varberg fulfilment
centre ramping up from mid-2025 (additional opex and D&A) and tougher comparisons.
We expect Apotea to show strong sales growth of 12% Y/Y in Q4(24). This is driven by both its
large segments, with Rx growing 13% Y/Y and Other Products up 11%. Rx is driven by strong
momentum amid ongoing improvements in Rx capacity. For Other Products (OTC & TG), the
growth is due to good sales momentum, available fulfilment capacity, and according to our
channel checks sales likely seeing strong Black Week performance. For instance, in our sample
study we note that Apotea had the lowest price for certain nail polishes which saw good Black
Week demand according to Klarna e-commerce sales data, and further backed up by positive
market comments from e.g. Lyko. We also note that Apotea announced in mid-November that
it had reached a milestone of SEK1.0bn in LTM beauty sales (16% of group Q3(24) LTM sales,
and 26% of non-Rx group sales). However, our e-commerce channel checks also suggest softer
Christmas sales, which likely offsets part of the Black Week performance. Finally, we note that
European peer Redcare Pharmacy grew non-Rx sales by a whole 22% in Q4(24), with good
performance across many European markets, and Rx up 37% driven by German e-prescriptions.

Our channel checks suggest strong
Black Week sales for Apotea,
especially within categories such as
beauty (~25% of LTM group non-Rx
sales)

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

We estimate a Q4(24) EBIT margin of 3.2%, up 0.9%-point Y/Y, despite a declining gross margin
Y/Y and Q/Q (seasonally greater discounting), driven by operating leverage. For reported EBIT,
we pencil in SEK37m (34m), dampened by SEK16m in expected listing costs. For operating cash
flow, we estimate ~SEK160m (of which SEK95m in WC release) and FCF post-lease of
SEK16m, hampered by SEK131m in capex for Varberg.

Apotea

Valuation
We initiate coverage with a HOLD recommendation and a multiples-based fair value of
SEK73, based on EV/EBIT(26e) of 21x, versus 23x at its current share price. This
currently represents a valuation premium (EV/EBIT(26e)) of ~100% versus key Nordic
online peers at 12x. Compared to European peer Redcare Pharmacy trading at 32x
EV/EBIT(26e) Apotea is at a discount, which could be justified by Redcare’s much
larger TAM and its 25% sales CAGR(23–26e) (~10%-points above Apotea’s), despite its
lower profitability. However, based on EV/S(26e) Apotea comes at a ~55% premium. We
consider Apotea the ‘gold standard’ compared to Nordic online peers and believe a
premium valuation is warranted owing to Apotea’s strong track record of high selffinanced growth, dominant market position with a long growth runway, and defensive
qualities. We argue that 2026e is a fairer reference year to value Apotea than 2025, as it
will be more representative of the underlying business’s performance due to the Varberg
fulfilment centre likely being fully operational. For this reason, we also include a DCF,
where we derive a relatively similar SEK72 fair value (9.2% WACC). However, we note
that EV/EBIT multiples for our full Nordic online retail peer group are also lower in
2026e (10x) than 2025e (13x). The online sector’s valuations are currently under pressure
due to weak consumer spending (barely affecting Apotea) and investor sentiment, with
considerably lower NTM multiples compared to both before and during the pandemic.
We believe the listed Swedish online peers that share the most similarities in terms of
business model (our key peers) are Boozt, Lyko and Haypp, which are trading at ~12x
EV/EBIT(26e). However, based on FCF yield for 2026e – i.e. once its near-term capex is
done – Apotea’s 4.3% is above Swedish key peers’ 3.7%. We calculate that if Apotea were
to continually deliver on its financial targets it would be valued in line with the Carnegie
Small Cap index’s (CSX) average P/E multiple by 2028e.

Relative valuation

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Key Nordic peers: Boozt, Lyko, Haypp
Online retail peer multiples are heavily
supressed currently due to much
weaker cyclical momentum postpandemic

Apotea is currently trading at 23x EV/EBIT(26e), well above Nordic peers. We note that the
online sector is currently under pressure due to weak consumer (barely affecting Apotea) and
investor sentiment, with low NTM multiples compared to historical multiples both before and
during the pandemic. The average EV/EBIT(26e) multiple for key Swedish peers with similar
metrics: Boozt, Lyko and Haypp is ~12x, and the median valuation for the entire Swedish online
retail sector under Carnegie’s coverage is 10x (note that EVs for all companies in our peer table
include leasing debt). Compared to Redcare Pharmacy, which as of 13 January traded at 32x
EV/EBIT(26e) and 0.66x EV/S(26e) per Factset, Apotea has a smaller TAM and relatively lower
growth, but has a much higher profitability. We consider Apotea the ‘gold standard’ compared
to Nordic online peers and believe a premium is warranted owing to Apotea’s stronger growth,
dominant market position with a long growth runway, and defensive qualities.
Characteristics of key peers (Boozt, Lyko, Haypp) that are similar to Apotea:
• Online market leader in its niche and geography
• High sales growth (8–18% sales CAGR(23–26e))
• Low gross margins
• Low to mid-single digit adj. EBIT margins
• Low AOVs (relatively)
• Low (relatively) marketing spend as a percentage of sales
• Low return ratios (excl. Boozt, albeit Boozt is considerably lower than its peer Zalando)
• Low share of private label

Boozt. Market leading multi-category online department store, mainly focused on fashion. It has
a highly automated fulfilment centre (AutoStore, which Apotea also uses a customised solution
of for some of its orders). Similar to Apotea, Boozt has a very low private label share and also
receives marketing contributions from suppliers. It has a relatively higher gross margin than
Apotea, but also much higher return rates (of ~35% vs <1% for Apotea).
Haypp. Online retailer of “snus” and nicotine pouches, selling in Europe and the US. It has no
private label products, relatively low gross margins, a low marketing ratio and close to 0% returns.
AOVs are slightly above Apotea but still relatively low. Its fulfilment centre is only semiautomated (pick-by-light), i.e. lower than Apotea’s. Haypp has a strong track-record of profitable
growth, although the business carries severe regulatory risks.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Lyko. Nordic online destination for beauty products utilising creative marketing strategies.
Similarities to Apotea include strong historical (and future expected per Carnegie estimates) sales
growth, similar product areas, low-single-digit and somewhat volatile EBIT margin, an automated
fulfilment centre (SSI Schäfer & Vanderlande) ongoing fulfilment centre automation project
completed in mid-2025, similar AOVs and very low return-rates. We note that Apotea has a lower
private label share of sales than Lyko (~1% vs ~7% per 2023, but both companies want to
improve their respective figure going forward). Apotea also has a relatively lower marketing ratio
and gross margin.
Redcare Pharmacy: Listed in the Netherlands with a ~EUR3bn market cap. SEK27bn in
sales(24e), with 12.5m active customers per Q4(24) and some 122m quarterly site visits, i.e. much
larger than Apotea, and with presence in Germany, France, Austria, Italy, Switzerland, the
Netherlands, and Belgium. Redcare states that its DACH segment has been generating a positive
adj. EBITDA margin over the past few years (H1(24): EUR+34m), while the international
segment is growing fast, but is loss-making at the EBITDA level (EUR-9m for H1(24)). Non-Rx
represented ~75% of sales (2023) for Redcare, vs ~65% for Apotea, but despite lower Rx,
Redcare has a higher AOV, whereas Apotea mentions higher AOVs within Rx. Factset consensus
expects Redcare to grow at a 25% sales CAGR(23–26), versus our estimate of 15% for Apotea
for the same period.
Through our research, we believe that Redcare has fulfilment and marketing ratios of roughly
~7% of sales each. We do not know Apotea’s fulfilment costs but we note that Redcare has a
higher marketing ratio (vs Apotea’s ~3%). Both companies have similar private label sales shares
of below 5%, but Apotea still has a ~3%-points higher gross margin. Redcare’s return rate is also
similar to Apotea’s at <1%. We note that Redcare’s share of repeat orders of 87% is below
Apotea’s 96%.

DocMorris. Founded in 1993 (initially named “Zur Rose”) and listed in 2017, DocMorris is
another listed online European pharmacy player with >9m active customers. We do not consider
it a good peer for Apotea due to its low growth, it being loss-making, and a business model based
on paper recipes (eRx very recently opened and at a low level). It has a highly automated fulfilment
centre in the Netherlands with capacity of 27m parcels per year. Its financial track record is
different from Apotea’s, with a Y/Y sales decline of -18% in 2022 and -10.5% in 2023. The gross
margin is relatively low at 21% (2023), although up from 15% in 2021, but the company still had
a -9% EBIT margin in 2023 (EBIT was CHF-83m).

We highlight that next-twelve-month (NTM valuation multiples (EV/EBIT and EV/Sales) for
the Nordic online retailers have declined significantly since their peak in 2021, when market
conditions were excellent.
For EV/S multiples peaked at ~2.25x in 2021, and are now since mid-2022 range-bound between
0.5–-0.75x, which is also well below pre-pandemic levels. In the medium term, we expect the
online migration trend to resume, which suggests a good growth runway for many of the online
retailers we have equity research coverage of, and likely higher multiples.

We note that when comparing EV/Sales for either Boozt or Redcare with Apotea’s 2026e
financials, the relative valuations are below our fair value for Apotea. Per our calculations, Apotea
would have an EV of SEK5.6bn fully based on Redcare’s EV/S(26e), based on Factset estimates;
compared to Boozt’s EV/S(26e), Apotea’s EV would be even slightly lower at ~SEK5.5bn.

Apotea

Long-term valuation potential

While we expect 2025 to be a transition year for Apotea, with no significant EBIT growth Y/Y
as Varberg ramps up from mid-2025 with additional near-term costs and lower capacity
utilisation, we expect strong growth and free cash flow over the medium and long-term, which
as a result would significantly lower Apotea’s valuation multiples after 2025e. This is further
supported by our DCF (SEK72), which points to a valuation close to our multiples-based fair
valuation.

Time to normal P/E

We make a valuation scenario in which we compare our estimates to Apotea’s long-term targets,
where it grows 15% annually until 2030e (long-term financial target represents a 15–19% sales
CAGR over the next 4–5 years, and to reach a 7–8% margin from 2028). We conclude that if
Apotea continues to deliver earnings growth in line with its target it would be valued at ~13.5x
P/E(28e), close to the Carnegie small cap index at ~13x P/E(28e).
Based on our estimates which are more conservative than Apotea’s financial targets, Apotea
would still trade at a small premium (P/E) to the CSX in 2030e based on its current market cap.

Apotea

DCF

We calculate a DCF to grasp the long-term value in Apotea, beyond near-term fulfilment centre
investments and potentially volatile margins. We see a long runway for structural growth for
Apotea as the online market leader in a market that is migrating online from the current ~21%
online penetration levels (Sweden), and adding more sales categories. We also see potential upside
from a similar journey for Apotea in Norway, and potentially also Finland in the long term.
In our DCF we calculate a fair value of ~SEK7.6bn (SEK72 per share), based on a 9.2% WACC
and an equity beta of 1.3, which is the same as we apply for e.g. Boozt. We note that our margin
assumptions (6–7% beyond year 5 (2028e)) are still slightly below Apotea’s long-term target of
7–8%, and that our assumed sales growth gradually tapers off to 2–6.5% beyond year 5.

Apotea

Valuation sensitivity

In the table below, we have highlighted the implied valuation multiples depending on Apotea’s
enterprise value and market cap, with the grey area representing the range between our fair value
and the current share price. In this range, Apotea’s implied adjusted EV/EBIT(26e) would be
16–27x (only including interest-bearing debt, i.e. not leasing debt), while its FCF(26e) yield would
be 3.6–6.0%, lifted by less capex in 2026e as the ongoing expansionary investments in Varberg
are completed (mid-2025).

Apotea

Dividends

Apotea’s main capital allocation focus is to drive profitable growth, but any surplus may still be
distributed to shareholders. We expect FCF to remain positive albeit dampened in 2024–25e due
to significant capex and working capital build-up both related to the new fulfilment centre working
at subscale initially, but with a strong improvement in Apotea’s free cash flow generation from
2026e due to significantly less capex. We expect this will lead to dividends from FY 2026e and
onward, which in that case would be decided upon at the annual general meeting and distributed
during H1(27). For 2026–27e, we forecast a dividend pay-out ratio of ~25% of net profit.
In a scenario with higher dividends – 40% payout already from FY 2024e, based on our net profit
estimates – we calculate that the dividend yield based on the current market cap would be ~1–
1.5% for 2025–27e.

Apotea

Historical public valuation from Creades

Creades, an investment company listed on the Swedish stock exchange, acquired ~5% of Apotea
in April 2017 for SEK121m. The ownership stake had not changed since then up until Apotea’s
listing in December 2024. The company has used a variety of valuation approaches including
DCF, P/E, EV/S (with various illiquidity discounts) and latest transactions. Since 2017 Creades’
implied valuation for Apotea has ranged from SEK2.5bn–9.7bn. Apotea’s valuation per Creades
Q3(24) report was SEK5.55bn, based on “latest transaction”. We think the ups-and-downs in
Apotea’s valuation according to Creades are similar to how publicly listed, online retailers’ share
prices have moved.
Creades held ~5% of Apotea since

Apotea

Company description
Apotea is the leading online pharmacy in Sweden, with a 43% online market share in 2023.
Apotea was launched in 2012 and quickly established a leading position in the somewhat
underdeveloped online pharmacy market. It offers lower prices, a wider assortment, and
fast and flexible deliveries compared to its peers, yet the business has essentially been
self-funded and has consistently been profitable since its first year of operation. The
company generated sales of SEK6.3bn LTM in Q3(24) and a sales CAGR(20–Q3(24)) of
12%. It generated an adjusted EBIT margin of 5.1% in Q3(24) (4.1% LTM) and targets a
3–5% margin short- to medium-term and 7–8% longer-term. The company also owns a
majority stake in Norway’s Apotera and a minority stake in Finnish company Apomera,
which currently contribute minimally to its sales and earnings, but could become relevant
growth drivers over time.

Apotea was launched in 2012, but originates from a small loss-making company called
Familjeapoteket which was launched in 2003. It was acquired by Apotea’s current CEO, Pär
Svärdson, and co-founders in 2011 and relaunched as Apotea one year later, and quickly turned
to into a profitable growth story. Before Apotea, Mr Svärdson was one of the co-founders of
Adlibris in 1997. Adlibris was one of the first online book retailers in the Nordics and is currently
the largest. Mr Svärdson and co-founders sold this business to Bonnier Group in 2011, and
shortly after went on to acquire and relaunch the business that became Apotea.
The relaunch of Apotea in 2012 came not long after the re-regulation of the Swedish pharmacy
market in 2009, suggesting that Apotea was one of the first online players to enter the market.
The business quickly grew and in 2018 Apotea moved to a new 38,000 sqm fulfilment centre in
Morgongåva, a small town 30 minutes west of Uppsala, 1.5 hours from Stockholm. Morgongåva
is also home to Adlibris’ main fulfilment centres, but otherwise the two businesses have no links
to each other. Initially, the fulfilment centre was mainly for manual picking and packing, and due
to significant excess capacity it also rented out space to several other online retailers (e.g.
Babyland, Widforss, Delitea). Apotea’s fulfilment centre has since become increasingly
automated, and at the start of 2022 the last external tenants moved out to allow room for Apotea’s
growth. The company initially focused its sales on over-the-counter (OTC) drugs and traded
goods (TG), but has gradually expanded its assortment of prescription drugs (Rx).

Ownership of Norwegian and Finnish
peers secured in 2022

Apotea

In November 2022 Apotea acquired a 59% stake in Norwegian company Apotera and a ~10%
stake in Finnish company Apomera. Both are online players similar to Apotea, but Norwegian
regulations are more similar to the Swedish market than the highly regulated Finnish market, and
both countries have less developed online pharmacy markets than their Swedish counterpart.
Apotera and Apomera are both operated separately and independently from Apotea. We estimate
that they are fully funded for at least the next few years, but we expect their contribution to group
sales, or potential burden on group earnings, will be negligible. We believe they should be
considered an upside option in the event the competitive and/or regulatory landscape changes
dramatically in either Norway (increasing online penetration) or Finland (changed regulation).
We note that Apotea’s current holding company is Apolea holding AB, which is under name
change to Apotea AB.

Assortment
Assortment gradually expanded from
around 2,000 SKUs in 2011…

Apotea’s assortment differs somewhat from a traditional pharmacy. Because it sells purely online
it lacks the restrictions of a physical store and can offer a significantly wider assortment than
traditional pharmacies. In 2011, before the business was acquired by Mr Svärdson and his cofounders, the company offered around 2,000 stock keeping units (SKUs), but in the first five
years after being acquired the assortment was expanded to 18,000 SKUs. The assortment at that
time was focused on OTC and TG, until 2019 when its Rx assortment was significantly increased.

The assortment has increased gradually and in 2023 amounted to ~46,000 SKUs, of which just
under half are Rx, while OTC and TG make up 27,000. This can be compared to a traditional
physical pharmacy, which typically carries 2,000–3,000 SKUs, and is also significantly more than
the ~16,000 SKUs (excluding Rx) carried by its largest online peers, Apohem and Meds.

Prescription drugs (Rx) make up 36%
of Q3(24) LTM sales, compared to
around 73% for the total Swedish
market

In its segment reporting, Apotea reports OTC and TG sales together. These made up about 62%
of the group’s Q3(24) LTM sales, while Rx made up just 36%. This can be compared to the
overall market penetration of 73% Rx, while OTC is 9% and TG 18%. We believe Apotea has a
higher share of OTC than the overall market, but we attribute the main difference in mix to
Apotea having a much higher share of TG products.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Besides traditional pharmacy products, Apotea carries a wide assortment of pharmacy-adjacent
products. The definition of what is pharmacy-adjacent is rather fluid; it currently includes
products such as skincare, sunscreen, make-up, hair-care, weight loss, and dietary supplements,
but also pet care, hygiene and cleaning, as well as sexual wellness. Over time, we believe Apotea
could expand its assortment even further to include even more SKUs and potentially also
additional categories, although we believe any new categories would have to be closely adjacent
to pharmaceutical products, health and wellness, to make strategic sense.

Assortment well suited for online sales
Regulation implies high entry barriers

Apotea private label skincare

20

Well-suited for online sales
We believe Apotea’s assortment is well suited to online sales. Most of its products are relatively
small in size and come in standardised packages, as well as having high prices in relation to their
weight. We also note that online return rates are exceptionally low. Selling online also offers a
discreet option to buy remedies for ailments that some consumers may consider embarrassing.
Meanwhile, selling pharmaceuticals online requires extensive regulatory compliance, the pricing
of prescription drugs is regulated and Rx sales offer a relatively low gross margin, which to us
suggests high entry barriers for new players.
Private label
Private label is rather new for Apotea, and currently makes up a small share of its sales. As of
June 2024, Apotea carried around 200 SKUs of private label products. These amounted to ~1%
of Apotea’s group sales. As a comparison, Apotek Hjärtat, the leading store-based pharmacy in
Sweden, had a private label share of around 19% of its total number of traded goods in 2023,
which we estimate is equivalent to around 4% of its group sales (based on Arthur D. Little’s
market data that TG was 19% of the market in 2023).
Private label products have several advantages over external branded products. Firstly, they
usually enable much higher gross margins, typically around 50%-points as opposed to 25-30%
for most external brands. If there is a product gap in the market, developing a private label
alternative could sometimes be a solution. And thirdly, having a significant private label
assortment offers insight into input costs and provides better negotiating power against suppliers.

15 January 2025

c

Apotea

We expect Apotea to continue expanding its private label assortment and believe this could be a
key driver of profitability going forward. Assuming that its private label grows from 1% of sales
to 3% of sales, which we believe could be a realistic target for the next five years, it would boost
Apotea’s gross margin by around 0.5%-point, which can be considered quite a significant
improvement for a low-margin business.

Pricing
Apotea: Low prices = key promise

Source: Apotea

Apotea’s prices are 11% below those
of online peers, 36% below those of
physical pharmacies

Pricing is a core part of Apotea’s strategy. The company’s key motto, which it uses in virtually all
of its advertising, promises low prices and fast, cost-free deliveries. Our impression is that the
company has strived to create a highly efficient low-cost structure to allow the group to keep
prices low enough to enable growth and discourage competition from undercutting its prices.
The company has a dynamic pricing strategy, which allows it to change its prices several times
daily. It uses proprietary digital systems to conduct automatic price comparison. Although it aims
to match the lowest prices from its competitors, it does not automatically duplicate the discount
campaigns from its peers, as all price changes are manual. Apotea does not have a customer
promise to always have the absolute lowest prices. Rather, it aims to assure its customers that
prices will always be sufficiently low for all its products.
Pricing is regulated for all prescription drugs (see Market Description on page 16 for more
details), but Apotea is free to set prices on OTC drugs and all TG. According to a study by Arthur
D. Little (13 June), Apotea’s prices for a selection of OTC and TG products were on average
11% below those of the other online pharmacies and 36% below prices from physical pharmacies.

Note that the price comparison was based on a selection of only 15 products, focusing on
bestsellers including painkillers from Ipren, Alvedon and Treo; Otrivin nose spray; CeraVe skin
lotion; and Flux mouthwash. The study was carried out by Arthur D. Little, but it was
commissioned by Apotea, suggesting that a study with a wider product range and/or a different
constituent might have shown a slightly different outcome. Either way, our impression from past
discussions with several other pharmacy retailers also seem to confirm Apotea’s role as a
disruptive challenger with a clear low-price profile.

Supply chain
700 suppliers – close to 40% of sales
(all Rx products) are sourced from
Tamro and Oriola

Apotea sources from around 700 suppliers, of which close to 40% of its sales are linked to Tamro
and Oriola, the only two wholesalers in Sweden that have the right (and obligation) to distribute
prescription drugs to approved pharmacists. Besides sourcing from Tamro and Oriola, Apotea
can also parallel import prescription drugs, which we estimate makes up close to 10% of Apotea’s
Rx volumes. A more detailed discussion of parallel imports and their implications is presented in
the market description chapter on page 16.
Besides the heavily regulated market for Rx drugs, Apotea’s reliance on individual suppliers is
relatively limited. The top 20 suppliers in OTC and TG accounted for 29% of group sales in
2023. Having an extensive supplier base and large SKU count suggests an entry barrier in itself.
It has taken Apotea more than two decades to build its current assortment, which significantly

15 January 2025

exceeds those of its key peers. Similarly, we believe it would take considerable time for any of its
peers to try to replicate its offer.

Customer insight is a key advantage vs
offline peers

Many of Apotea’s suppliers sell their products only to pharmacies, not grocery or beauty chains.
This suggests that Apotea is an important retail channel for many of its suppliers. Unlike physical
retailers that have rather limited knowledge of most of their TG and OTC customers, Apotea has
detailed knowledge, not just of their identity, but also their browsing record, suggesting that it
knows what searches were made before consumers decided on the products they finally selected.
These data insights provide a valuable tool, not least for Apotea’s suppliers.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Apotea’s data insights suggest that it can market products to consumers based on its previous
searches. There are obviously restrictions related to integrity, as few consumers want their search
record for embarrassing ailments to be reflected in banner ads when they continue outside
Apotea’s website. Still, it has extensive opportunities for add-on sales and marketing of alternative
products while customers are browsing for products.
Marketing contributions from supplier
made up around 2% of 2023 sales

Another key revenue and earnings opportunity comes from joint marketing campaigns, as Apotea
offers its suppliers opportunities to market their products, both on its websites and through joint
campaigns in external media. Fixed marketing contributions are booked under services, which
made up around 2% of group sales in 2023, while volume-driven market contributions are
booked under cost of goods sold. As costs related to these revenues are generally low, we believe
they make up quite a significant share of group earnings. We discuss this revenue in more detail
under Financials on page 38.
Fulfilment
Fulfilment is a core part of Apotea’s strategy and, we believe, also a key advantage relative to its
competitors. By keeping its fulfilment costs lower than its competitors, Apotea can offer lower
prices while still generating an operating profit, thereby making it difficult for new as well as
established players to catch-up to its clear lead in the Swedish online pharmacy market.

Fulfilment is focused on a 38,000sqm
fulfilment centre in Morgongåva

22

Apotea has its head office at Wennergren Centre in central Stockholm, which houses most of its
management, a small 1,000 sqm warehouse and around 20 pharmacists. It also has a second
1,300sqm warehouse in Lidingö (Larsberg, 9km from Wennergren Centre), which houses around
35 pharmacists. But the bulk of Apotea’s fulfilment is managed from its highly automated
38,000sqm fulfilment centre in Morgongåva, a small town around 30 minutes west of Uppsala,
and around 1.5 hours from Stockholm.

The Morgongåva fulfilment centre was mainly manual until around 2020, but has since become
increasingly automated. It contains several fully or semi-automated fulfilment solutions, including
A-frame and Pick-by-light from SSI Schäfer, AutoStore with picking robots from
eOperator/Element logic, Vmax from BD Rowa for picking slow-moving prescription drugs,
SGA conveyor systems, and packing robots from ABB. The fulfilment centre can manage up to
100,000 orders per day if working at 100% of its capacity. At present its daily average output is
around 40,000 orders.

Pharmacists
Recruitment of pharmacists has long been a key challenge, both for Apotea and for its peers.
From 2009 to 2020 there was strong expansion in the number of pharmacies, but the number of
pharmacists failed to catch up. However, in more recent years, the number of store-based
pharmacies has decreased somewhat, which we believe may help facilitate Apotea’s recruitment
of new pharmacists. One challenge for Apotea is that its logistics centre in Morgongåva is around
40–50km from its nearest major cities (Uppsala, Enköping and Västerås), which makes it less
appealing for pharmacists. To help mitigate this problem, the company has pharmacists working
from a warehouse adjacent to its head office in Stockholm, as well as a second small warehouse
in Lidingö, just a few km east of its head office.

Norway
Norwegian Apotera adds 2% to sales,
while generating a minor loss

24

During autumn 2022, Apotea acquired a 59.1% stake in Norwegian company Apotera. Apotera
is a small challenger with a number-two position in the rather underdeveloped Norwegian online
pharmacy market. It is operated independently from Apotea by its original founder; besides
15 January 2025

c

Apotea

know-how there are relatively limited links with either Apotea in Sweden or Apomera in Finland
so far. Apotera is consolidated into the group, but its sales and earnings are not reported
separately. Still, in 2023 Apotera generated sales of ~NOK113m, equivalent to around 2% of
group sales. It reported an operating loss of NOK6.3m in the same year, but is gradually nearing
break-even earnings, according to Apotea’s management, and unless there is a dramatic change
in the Norwegian competitive or regulatory landscape, we believe that a significant further capital
infusion into Apotera seems unlikely, at least in the short term.
Norwegian pharmacy market worth
around SEK66bn – 60% the size of the
Swedish market

According to a market study by ADL, the Norwegian health-related market was worth around
SEK66bn in 2023, compared to SEK110bn for the Swedish market (pharmacy and OTC/TG in
non-pharmacy channel). The Norwegian market has rather similar regulations to the Swedish
market. In 2010 it was re-regulated, breaking the state-owned monopoly to allow private players
approved by the regulator to enter. Though re-regulated just one year after the Swedish market,
it took until 2016 before prescription drugs were made available to online customers. Online
migration has been significantly slower than in Sweden, and Norwegian online penetration was
only 5% in 2023, which can be compared to around 20% in Sweden. We believe the absence of
a significant driving force, as Apotea has been in Sweden, may be a key reason for the slower
development in Norway.
We view Apotera as a potential upside option for the Apotea group to grow its sales outside its
core market, particularly a few years from now when growth in Sweden may have started to slow.
However, we have not assumed any material contribution from Apotera in our assumptions for
Apotea.

Finnish market is still restricted from
selling Rx or OTC drugs online

15 January 2025

Finland
If Apotera is a small challenger in Norway, Apomera in Finland is even smaller. Apotea has only
~10% ownership, suggesting that it is reported as unlisted shares and not consolidated into
Apotea’s accounts. Unlike the Swedish and Norwegian markets, the Finnish market has yet to be
re-regulated. Only local licensed pharmacists are allowed to operate pharmacies and online sales
of pharmaceuticals are restricted to state-owned pharmacies and certain individual pharmacies.
25

c

Apotea

Apomera does not sell either prescription or OTC drugs, only traded goods, including skin-, hairand wound care products, wellness and supplements, to name a few. We believe Apotea’s
ownership in Apomera mainly serves as a door opener to expand in the Finnish market if it were
to be re-regulated, to match its Swedish and Finnish counterparts.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Apomera generated an operating loss in 2023 equivalent to around SEK9m (although Apotea’s
ownership is restricted to 10.6%). Still, our impression is that the business is fully funded at least
for the next few years, unless the Finnish pharmacy market were to dramatically change. We have
assumed no sales or earnings contribution from Finland for the next few years.

Market description
The Swedish pharmacy market was worth around SEK58bn in 2023, according to SCB. It
was re-regulated in 2009, which meant that the former monopolist was broken up and
sold off in clusters to external parties, while allowing new players to seek permission to
sell OTC and Rx drugs both in physical stores and online. According to SCB, the Swedish
pharmacy market grew at a CAGR(2000–23) of 4.3%, more than double the average
annual GDP growth (2.1%) during the same period. We view this sector as defensive and
note in SCB data that the market grew at a 3.2% CAGR(2007–10), showing no signs of
slowdown during the financial crisis. Online penetration for pharmacy products is around
20% according to the Swedish Pharmacy Association, and data from PostNord reveals
that pharmacy has been one the strongest growing online categories in Sweden in recent
years, particularly in the last two. Arthur D. Little predicts growth for online pharmacy,
at a CAGR(23–28e) of 13%. Apotea is the biggest online retailer by a wide margin, with a
43% online market share and a 9% share of the total market, according to the Swedish
Pharmacy Association.

The Swedish pharmacy market
Swedish pharmacy market is worth
SEK58bn, of which 73% Rx, 8% OTC,
19% TG

According to SCB, the Swedish pharmacy market was worth around SEK58bn in 2023. The
market in this case is defined as pharmaceuticals (Rx and OTC drugs) and adjacent products that
are sold through pharmacy chains, generally referred to as traded goods (TG). The SCB data also
shows that, measured in sales, nearly three-quarters (73%) of the market consists of prescription
drugs (Rx) while over-the-counter drugs (OTC, such as paracetamol, 8%) and Traded Goods
(TG, such as skincare products, 19%) make up the rest. During its first years of operating, Rx
only made up a very small share of Apotea’s offering. Although this has increased significantly in
recent years, it still only made up around 35% of sales in 2023, suggesting it had less than half the
Rx penetration compared to traditional pharmacies.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

In reality, we find that the total pharmacy market is nearly twice as big as the SEK58bn reported
by SCB. Firstly, since 2009 a selection of some of the most commonly used OTC drugs have
been made available for sale outside traditional pharmacies, for instance in grocery retail,
convenience stores and petrol stations. But more importantly, there is a long list of pharmacyadjacent products, such as beauty and personal care, wellness, nutrition and pet care which are
typically sold outside store-based pharmacies, but which we believe most consumers still closely
associate with health and wellbeing. A wide variety of TG products in pharmacy offerings is also
commonly available in other outlets, such as grocery stores. Since Apotea is an online retailer
with few limitations regarding number of items, it can tap its sales from a much wider addressable
market compared to its store-based peers. According to a study by Arthur D. Little, this expanded
addressable health-related market was worth around SEK110bn in 2023, i.e. almost twice the size
of the pharmacy-based market.

Swedish monopoly was re-regulated in
2009 – paving the way for online sales
of Rx and OTC drugs

2009 re-regulation
From 1970 to 2009, the Swedish pharmacy market was operated as a monopoly, with state-owned
Apoteket being the only player allowed to sell Rx and OTC pharmaceuticals. However, the
market was re-regulated in 2009, and has since undergone significant changes. Apart from
breaking up the monopolist, it has also resulted in a significant increase in the number of
pharmacies, longer opening hours, and also competition from grocery retailers for certain OTC
drugs. The re-regulation also paved the way for online pharmacies such as Apotea (since 2012),
but also its closest peers Meds and Apohem (which were both launched in 2018).

Timeline: The Swedish pharmacy market – re-regulation and consolidation

Source: Company information, Swedish Medical Products Agency

The re-regulation of the Swedish pharmacy market in 2009 meant that the state-owned monopoly
Apoteket AB was forced to divest 616 of its 946 pharmacies in different clusters to new owners.
The new systems allowed parties to obtain licences from the Swedish Medical Products Agency
to engage in the retailing of pharmaceutical products. In addition, certain OTC pharmaceuticals
became available in retail channels other than the pharmacies. Changes were also made to the
supply of pharmaceuticals to hospitals, allowing for other players to run hospital pharmacies.
Two thirds of the former monopolist’s 946 pharmacies were sold in clusters to four private
companies for a total of about SEK6bn. The first cluster was sold to the private equity group
Altor, which became Apotek Hjärtat. A second cluster, which consisted of hospital pharmacies,
28

Apotea

was acquired by the private equity group Priveq and Investor Growth Capital and named
Vårdapoteket. A third cluster was bought by Oriola-KD and operated as Kronans Droghandel.
A fourth cluster was acquired by the private equity group Segulah and named Medstop. This left
a fifth cluster, which was an establishment of 150 pharmacies, with private entrepreneurs as part
owners, called Apoteksgruppen.

Margins have declined since 2009 as
number of pharmacies increased from
~950 to ~1,430 by 2020

Data from the Swedish Pharmacy Association shows a sharp increase in the number of
pharmacies in the years immediately following re-regulation, from 946 state-owned Apoteket
pharmacies to a peak of 1,433 pharmacies in 2020. Since then, the number has steadily decreased,
and amounted to 1,396 in March 2024. Meanwhile, the average profitability for the pharmacy
retailers has been in near-constant decline over the past decade; according to the Swedish
Pharmacy Association, the sector’s EBIT margin has dropped from around 3.3% in 2016 to a
mere 1.6% in 2023, which is lower than Apotea’s average operating margin of 2.1% in the same
period, not to mention its 4.1% adjusted EBIT margin for LTM Q3(24). Besides having opened
too many physical pharmacies, we believe that the strong growth of online pharmacies has been
partly responsible for the overall decline in profitability for the sector. Apart from a rapid
migration from stores to online sales, we believe that the price transparency that online retailers
offer has put pressure on margins for the incumbent store-based pharmacies as well.

Competitive landscape

After significant consolidation and ownership changes, the number of store-based pharmacy
chains has been reduced to four: Apoteket (the former monopolist); Apotek Hjärtat (owned by
ICA Gruppen) which acquired Vårdapoteket in 2013; Kronans Apotek, which bought Medstop
in 2013 and merged with Apoteksgruppen in 2022; and finally Doz Apotek, which has expanded
organically since 2010, previously under the names DocMorris and Lloyds Apotek.

Of these, Apotek Hjärtat is the biggest player in the overall market, with a 32% market share in
2023, followed by the former monopolist Apoteket (30% share) and Kronans Apotek (22%),
according to the Swedish Pharmacy Association. Apotea is the fourth biggest player with a 9%
share of the total market, but it has 43% market share in online sales, where it is more than twice
the size of its nearest competitor (Apoteket) and around eight times the size of its nearest online
pureplay peer, Apohem (Meds was #2 up until 2024).

period. The industry has also proved to be more or less immune to cyclicality, we note. For
instance, the financial crisis had a quite limited impact, as reflected in continued growth at a 3.2%
CAGR during 2007–10, despite Swedish GDP growth having been close to zero in the same
period, according to SCB. Even Covid had a relatively limited effect on total pharmacy sales;
Swedish market growth was 4.4% annually from 2019 to 2022, showing no tangible signs of either
pick-up or slowdown compared to the years prior. Meanwhile, growth of the online market
accelerated considerably more and, unlike most other online categories, it has continued to grow
strongly also post-Covid.

The total Swedish online market has grown sharply in the past 15 years. According to statistics
from PostNord, the Swedish online market grew rather consistently at a rate of around 15%
annually from 2010 until 2019. The market accelerated significantly during Covid, with growth
rates above 40% from Q2(20) to Q1(21).

At the peak of the pandemic, many online retail experts assumed that the accelerated growth
would be structural, and that market growth would continue at around 15% annually from the
new higher level. Instead, the market fell sharply in 2022–23. PostNord data shows that the
Swedish online market fell for seven consecutive quarters, from Q4(21) to Q2(23).
We believe online demand was in part hampered by mean reversion to physical retail, but mainly
by a sharp drop in consumers’ disposable income, driven by a steep rise in inflation and higher
interest rates. PostNord statistics indicate that a decade (2010–19) of consistently strong 15%
annual online growth has slowed to a CAGR(19–23) of a mere 9.7%. Put differently, it appears

that the online growth since the start of the pandemic ended up being a lot slower than if the
pandemic had not occurred at all.
Pharmacy by far the strongest growing
online category since 2022

The online pharmacy market has proved to be a great exception to the slowdown seen in other
online categories. Although online growth for the pharmacy segment slowed markedly from
Q4(21) to Q3(22), due to very tough comparisons, it has since then picked-up considerably, as is
evident in the statistics reported by HUI/PostNord, presented below. Since 2022, it has
consistently been the strongest growing category in the Swedish online market.

Swedish online pharmacy market is
worth SEK12bn and is estimated to
grow 13% (23–28e) according to
Arthur D. Little

In 2023 the Swedish online pharmacy market made up SEK12.3bn in sales, according to Arthur
D. Little, suggesting that it accounted for just over 21% of the total market, up from a penetration
of less than 10% as recently as 2019. The online pharmacy market has significantly outgrown
physical retail, with a sales CAGR(20–23) of over 15% vs 6% growth for the total market.
According to Arthur D. Little, this strong growth is set to continue, with a pace at around a 13%
CAGR(23–28e), which can be compared to its prediction of total market growth of around 4%

be a key growth driver for Apotea in the years to come.

Benchmarking

Relative to peers, Apotea offers what we consider to be an appealing mix of strong growth and
decent profitability. We note that its growth rate has almost consistently outperformed the storebased pharmacies by a significant margin, and although its profitability has typically been lower
than the two market leaders, Apotek Hjärtat and Apoteket, it has been well above all the other
challengers.

Apohem and Meds have aggregate
losses of SEK1bn 2018–23

The online retailers Meds and Apohem are both newcomers that were launched in 2018. In the
past five years they have both reported significantly stronger growth rates than Apotea, but from
a significantly lower base. However, unlike Apotea’s consistent track record of profitability since
launch, through 2023 neither of them have even been close to reporting profitability. We estimate
the aggregate operating losses from 2018 to 2023 for Meds and Apohem to have been around
SEK500m and SEK450m, respectively. As a comparison, the owners of Apotea have invested
around SEK10m of capital in the company since start, the rest of its expansion has been selffunded.

Regulation

Apotea has several regulatory counterparts. Firstly, licenses to engage in the retailing of
pharmaceutical products are granted by the Medical Products Agency (Läkemedelsverket), which
is also responsible for regulation and surveillance of the sale, manufacturing and registration of
pharmaceuticals, as well as the classification of which medicines are prescription-only (Rx) or
prescription-free (OTC).
The Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits Agency (TLV, Tandvårds- och
läkemedelsförmånsverket) is responsible for pricing and pharmacy retail margin for Rx products
and also decides whether a pharmaceutical product should be covered by the ‘high costs
threshold’ benefit scheme (‘högkostnadskydd’) that covers all Swedish residents and hence partly
is subsidised by the government. Distribution of Rx products is strictly managed through two
approved wholesalers, Tamro and Oriola, whereas OTC and TG products are either shipped
through external wholesalers or directly from suppliers.

Key authorities in the Swedish pharmacy market

Rx pricing is regulated – remuneration
is based on a fixed mark-up

Pricing model for Rx drugs
Pharmacy remuneration for Rx dispensing (also called the pharmacy retail margin) is regulated by
the TLV and structured as a mark-up between the wholesale price paid by pharmacies and the
sales price they charge their customers. The margin is set to consider the profitability in relation
to the societal needs for availability, service and quality. Because of how this payment model
works, Rx volumes rather than value are what is most important for pharmacies’ earnings. This
is important to keep in mind when thinking about the market growth for Rx products.
According to TLV, around 90% of Rx products have input prices below SEK1,000, which
corresponds to a gross profit for the pharmacy of around SEK45–73. This margin was last
updated by TLV on 1 March 2024 and represented an increase of around SEK3–5 per drug.
Above this, pharmacies also receive an extra SEK13 per package when they sell generic
medicines.

Parallel imports to support margins
Pharmacies can improve the Rx margin from parallel imports, which allow medicines approved
in other EU member states to be marketed in Sweden, provided the products have no therapeutic
difference from the equivalent nationally authorised products. Parallel import of pharmaceutical
products (Px) is a form of arbitrage based on price differences between markets in the EU. With
Px, pharmacies can negotiate prices below the official Swedish purchasing price and earn an extra
margin on Rx drugs.
Parallel imports of Rx fell from 20% in
2013 to 5.5% in 2023 – Apotea was
around 10%

According to IQVIA, the use of parallel imports rose sharply in the years following re-regulation
rising from 8% of prescription drugs in 2009 to 20% in 2013, which we believe may partly have
been driven by greater efforts to improve profitability by those who had recently bought into the
pharmacy market. We note that the use of parallel import is often concentrated to rather limited
number of SKUs and can therefore vary significantly from one year to the next, depending on
availability, the price gap between different markets and currency effects. In the past decade,
however, we note that the share of parallel imports has decreased significantly, landing at a mere
5.5% in 2023. Apotea, however, had a share of around 10%.

Comparisons to other markets
The Norwegian market follows a similar model as the Swedish and UK markets; it was reregulated in 2010, one year after the Swedish market. Meanwhile many other markets in northern
Europe remain tightly regulated, based on a guild system, which means that besides state-owned
monopolists, only local licensed pharmacists are allowed to operate pharmacies, so there are no
independently owned pharmacy-chains, while online sales of Rx and OTC alike are restricted to
state-owned pharmacies and certain individual pharmacies. We believe that the 2009 re-regulation
was a clear prerequisite for the success of Apotea, as the combination of Rx and OTC drugs adds
significant reliability, appeal and scale compared to a retailer that only carries traded goods.

Changing regulations
We note that regulations in various jurisdictions could change over time. For instance, there is an
ongoing matter at the Swedish Medical Products Agency regarding a regulatory change for online
purchases of pharmacy products, where Apotea has been vocal in commenting on the proposal.
The issue is related to if it should be allowed to deliver products purchased online to the
customer’s unlocked mailbox or doorstep, where the item could get stolen (“easy to grab” (Swe:
lätt greppbart)”), which could potentially lead to prescribed products getting in the wrong hands.
Apotea has worked with the regulatory body and the company’s best assumption as of November
2024 is that this would have only a small effect on costs and volumes, as most deliveries could
get rerouted through various methods and delivered in other ways, also as the shipping companies
are incentivised to deliver the order. We note that Apotea has also mentioned that it already has
ID control requirements at home-delivery for more sensitive products, such as certain Rx
products or some other more expensive products.

Apotea

Growth strategy
Apotea aims to double sales over the next 4–5 years from the LTM Q3(24) level of
~SEK6bn, per its financial targets, implying a sales CAGR of 15–19% over the respective
periods. This would be achieved by capitalising on tailwinds from increased online
penetration in the Swedish pharmacy market worth ~SEK60bn, according to Arthur D.
Little, which expects the online portion to experience a 13% sales CAGR during 2024–
28. To reach its target, which implies 2–6%-point annual market outperformance, Apotea
says it will focus on 1) maintaining operational excellence; 2) expanding its Rx sales, and
3) growth in Norway. OTC drugs and traded goods (TG) together represent less than a
third of the total SEK58bn pharmacy channel, while the same categories in channels
outside pharmacies make for an additional SEK51bn market. We see good potential for
Apotea to drive growth by capturing more OTC/TG sales currently outside the pharmacy
channel, leveraging its market-leading position in overall online retail in Sweden
(PostNord). Within Rx, Apotea’s market share is only ~4% in Sweden despite
representing ~35% of group sales 2023, which indicates a long Rx growth runway at
similar unit economics as OTC/TG orders. Apotea has also taken its first steps outside
Sweden, acquiring a majority stake in the small online pharmacy Apotera in 2022 in
Norway, which it will support through best-practice sharing to ‘win’ the Norwegian
market, which is gradually moving online (5% online penetration currently, per Arthur D.
Little), which we calculate could add ~NOK3bn in sales in a long-term blue-sky scenario.

Over the same period, the online penetration has increased from 4% to 21%, according to Arthur
D. Little, which also expects the online pharmacy market to continue its strong performance,
rising to 31% penetration by 2028. We believe that Apotea should be able to leverage its marketleading position (43% market share online 2023, and 9% total market share (Arthur D. Little)) to
drive future sales growth as the online penetration in the growing pharmacy market increases.

Expand Rx capacity and sales

For Rx specifically, data from Arthur D. Little shows that the online share of the pharmacy
market is 15% (2023), which is lower than for the overall online pharmacy market’s 21%
penetration. Arthur D. Little projects that the Rx online penetration will increase to 25% by 2028
(versus 31% penetration for the full online pharmacy market). Apotea, which currently has 35%
of its sales towards Rx, sees increased online Rx penetration as an important growth opportunity.
Apotea claims a market share within total Swedish Rx market of just 4%. Apotea is aiming to
take advantage of this Rx online adoption by 1) investing in automated Rx capacity in Varberg,
and 2) improving pharmacist recruitment. In addition, Arthur D. Little expects the overall Rx
online market penetration to increase due to more closures of physical pharmacies (owing to
weak profitability) and continued Rx demand.

Apotea currently has 35% of sales
towards RX, but only a 4% Rx market
share in Sweden, hence substantial
sales potential remains

According to Apotea, there is a lack of pharmacists available to hire, but as physical pharmacies
continue their recent trend of closing stores (hence requiring fewer in-store pharmacists) from
currently “high” levels (per Apotea’s management), there is an opportunity for Apotea to recruit
these pharmacists to increase its Rx capacity and subsequently its sales. We write more about the
offline pharmacy decline further down in this section. Its new fulfilment centre in Varberg will
also have 15 pharmaceutical workstations (can add another 15 as needed), which due to its
location should help Apotea to recruit more pharmacists. We find that Varberg is well-situated
close to the large cities Gothenburg and Malmö. We note that Lund University (since 2012) near
Malmö and Gothenburg University both have pharmacist programmes.

Varberg is close to large cities

Source: Apotea

Apotea is working to increase sales efficiency for its Rx personnel, which it views as a bottleneck.
We calculate that annual sales per Rx personnel are high, at nearly SEK15m in 2023, an increase
of 7% since 2021 as Apotea continues to improve efficiency for Rx orders. We note that to
improve Rx capacity, Apotea has historically opened two Rx fulfilment branches in Stockholm
(one in its Sveavägen office and one on Lidingö).

benchmarking by Arthur D. Little, Apotea clearly has the widest assortment (27,000 SKUs excl.
Rx), and the lowest prices (36% lower than offline peers, and 11% below online/omnichannel
peers). It also offers free delivery without any minimum order qualification level.

Apotea expects growth to be fuelled by keeping its customer retention high (e.g. 96% repeat
orders in 2023), and consistently increasing its customer base (~2.9m in 2023) through continued
high customer intake (~10,000 new customers per week during FY 2023). In the graph below,
we can see that each annual cohort to a large extent remains active customers (placing at least
one order per year) at Apotea, and over time increases its purchasing through Apotea.

We believe Apotea will benefit from increased online penetration and be able to continuously
gain new clients and increase purchasing from existing clients as it is the preferred online retail
outlet in Sweden (PostNord, e-barometern 2022) and has high customer ratings. Online
customers, in our view, tend not to be loyal to a particular outlet and thus Apotea needs to keep
its high customer-focus.

We see in company financial data that Apotea grew at a 19% sales CAGR during 2019–23. We
calculate that volume growth (number of orders) explains ~13%-points, while an increasing
average order value (AOV) explains 5.5%-points. According to external data, OTC prices
increased by 7.7% between June 2023 and August 2024 (Apotekskollen), which is slightly above
Apotea’s AOV change, however, we note that Apotea’s AOV also benefits strongly from
increased Rx sales.

Growth within pharmacy-related products
Opportunity to increase sales of
traded goods and OTC also outside
the pharmacy channel, this nearly
doubles the Swedish TAM

42

We see an opportunity for Apotea to grow within pharmacy-related products which are sold in
channels outside of pharmacies, a market which according to Arthur D. Little amounted to
SEK51bn in Sweden in 2023 (nearly as large as the SEK58bn total pharmacy channel in the same
year). This category is essentially everything you can buy in a pharmacy that is not Rx, and includes
OTC non-prescription drugs as well as traded goods (TG) such as pet care/food, and consumer
health and beauty/personal care products.

Sweden: addressable market break-down by segment (SEKbn)

1) Total pharmacy channel in Norway of SEK 33bn and total addressable market of 66bn in 2023.
2) Sales not through pharmacies, such as other OTC categories, consumer health and beauty/personal care.
3) Potential expansion into pharmacy related and adjacent segments such as fitness, health technology/electronics and home products.

Hiring more pharmacists to increase
Rx capacity

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Market growth is mostly coming from
online channel

To drive non-Rx category sales further, Apotea aims to continuously push clients to widen their
purchasing patterns to shop for additional staples categories at Apotea. Apotea expects further
Rx capacity to fuel both Rx sales growth, and cross-selling into other category sales within OTC
and TG, which Apotea historically has seen happens once new clients find Apotea when
searching for an Rx product. A wider category purchase pattern from consumers over time should
be supportive for gradually increasing AOVs, which in turn should benefit Apotea’s unit
economics and thereby its operating margins.
We note that in terms of market growth per product category, the online channel has benefitted
more than in-person sales, according to Swedish Pharmacy Association’s sector reports, whose
data shows that market growth during the period 2018–23 for TG was ~100% from online,
OTC’s growth was ~90% within online, and Rx saw ~50% of growth within online.
An individual Rx product typically comes with a lower gross margin than OTG/TG, but
according to Apotea it increases AOVs and decreases delivery cost per order due to generally
higher sales price, and typically a small size and weight. Hence, it has similar unit economics to
non-Rx orders, despite a dilutive gross-margin (19–20% vs ~27% for the group in 2023).

Apotea’s Rx sales is profitable, offline
pharmacies typically have negative Rx
margins, according to Sveriges
Apoteksförening 2018

15 January 2025

We also note that Apotea’s Rx sales are profitable, while offline pharmacies typically have negative
margins from Rx (even before capital costs), owing to a larger fixed cost base, according to a
report from Sveriges Apoteksförening in 2018. We note that Apotea, which has grown strongly
within the profitable OTC and TG segments, has likely expedited the decline in offline pharmacy
by taking the profitable sales volumes from offline pharmacies that are necessary for them to
cover costs through upselling. As a result, the number of pharmacies in Sweden, which increased
from ~930 at the time of the re-regulation in 2009, to a peak of 1,430 in 2020, is now gradually
declining, falling below 1,400 as of March 2024.

Growth in Norway
Acquired presence in Norway since
2022, represents 2% of sales

Apotea has had a small presence in Norway since 2022, when it acquired a majority stake (~59%
in 2023) in the company Apotera. Apotera had sales of NOK113m in 2023 (~2% of group sales)
and according to Arthur D. Little is the #2 online pharmacy in Norway, behind Farmasiet which
is 5x its size. The Norwegian pharmacy market is ~60% the size of Sweden’s, at NOK33bn for
Rx, or NOK66bn also including non-pharmacy category purchases in 2023, according to Arthur
D. Little. As of 2023, Apotera has ~75% of sales to the TG category, and only about ~7% to Rx
(for Apotea ~35% of sales is Rx).

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

The company is operated by its two founders, which Apotea’s management and operations teams
support by sharing best-practices and tangible synergies through technology, procurement and
fulfilment, while also helping Apotera improve supplier traction and negotiating power. The
Norwegian company has a similar go-to-market strategy as Apotea has in Sweden, which is based
on an inexpensive customer offering with fast, cost-free shipping. Since 2024, Apotera has its
own logistics centre in Oslo.
Apotea owns >50% of Apotera and thus consolidates it into the group accounting. Apotea’s
management and operations teams support Apotera in its journey, but the business decisions are
made by the two founders. The company is “close to break-even” according to management and
hence it dilutes Apotea’s margin slightly.

2023 to 12% 2028

Substantial sales potential in Norway if
Apotera is successful

We see the Norwegian opportunity as an interesting upside option for Apotea provided that it
does not dilute Apotea’s focus on the core Swedish market. By 2028, Arthur D. Little estimates
that the online penetration in Norway could be 12%, versus 5% in 2023, which is well below the
21% online penetration in Sweden, partly as Norway was re-regulated later than the Swedish
market.
We conduct a scenario for the Norwegian sales potential based on different potential market
shares for Apotera (~7% currently, we calculate) and online penetration rates for the overall
pharmacy market (5% currently). Based on a 12% online penetration and a 35% online market
share (i.e. 1%-point larger than Farmasiet currently, per our calculations, thus making Apotera
the largest online player in Norway) we conclude that in a positive scenario Apotera’s sales in
2028 could be NOK1.4bn. In a blue-sky scenario, if we pencil in the same online penetration as
in Sweden (currently, expected to rise to 31% by 2028 per Arthur D. Little), and Apotea’s current
market share (~45%), we calculate sales potential of NOK3.1bn for Apotera.
In our explicit estimates, given a similar Y/Y sales growth trajectory as Apotea during 2016–18
(despite Apotea’s larger sales base of ~SEK590m in 2015), we forecast that sales in Norway could
grow to NOK390m by 2026e (51% sales CAGR 2023–26e), which we view as conservative,
assuming a successful expansion in Norway, as suggested by our blue-sky scenario.

Expanding EBIT margin through operating leverage
Margin potential from higher gross
margins and operating leverage

46

Apotea targets a 7–8% EBIT margin in the ‘long-term’, versus 3.9% LTM Q3(24) and 4.1%
adjusted. We believe long-term for Apotea is between 5–10 years. Apotea expects two thirds of
this to be driven by gross margin improvements and the remainder by opex improvements. We
note that Apotea does not include any pricing increases (above inflation) to drive margins, which

we attribute to a desire to keep an attractive customer proposition and to keep up the pressure
on smaller and loss-making peers.
The gross margin expansion can be divided into two areas: 1) procurement, and 2) private label.
For procurement, Apotea expects better purchasing prices from scale, collaboration with
suppliers (marketing contribution), and increased parallel import of Rx products (at ~10%
currently). Apotea aims to increase its portfolio of private label products and their share of sales,
which is gross-margin accretive. As of June 2024, it had ~200 private label SKUs representing
~1% of net sales, while, according to its 2023 annual report, peer Apotek Hjärtat (owned by the
food-retailer ICA) had a ~19% private label share of sales in non-Rx products 2023.
For opex improvements, we expect that: operating leverage as part of the cost base is fixed so
and should hence increase less than sales incrementally, personnel costs as a share of sales will
decline due to automation and efficiency, and for a low-cost mindset to be promoted across the
organisation.

Apotea

Financials
Apotea has a strong track-record of growth with consistent profitability and an asset-light
business model that has enabled self-funded growth investments in automation of
fulfilment centres, ~SEK100m in dividends 2016–22 combined, and lower consumer
prices than competitors to strengthen its market position. Apotea began operations in
2012 and reached ~SEK1bn in sales by 2016 (EBIT SEK15m), and SEK2.7bn by 2019,
before the pandemic. During the pandemic, sales grew rapidly as more customer groups
ventured online, and demand was supported by Covid-preventive products, reaching
SEK4.6bn total sales in 2021. The company’s target is to double sales in 4–5 years to
~SEK12bn (a 15–19% CAGR) as it leverages its leading online market position, expands
Rx sales, and grows in Norway. We pencil in SEK9.4bn by 2027e, representing a 14.5%
sales CAGR(23–27e). Apotea targets a short- to medium-term EBIT margin of 3–5%,
compared to its 4.1% adj. EBIT margin per LTM Q3(24), and 4.4% in H1(24). We note
that Apotea is investing heavily in its second highly automated fulfilment centre, located
in Varberg, with expected capex of SEK350m–380m, building on its previous automation
experience. We expect utilisation to ramp up during H2(25) after the new fulfilment
centre is completed in mid-2025, which we expect will initially burden the EBIT margin
due to higher D&A and opex with low utilisation initially. We expect adj. EBIT(25e) to
remain largely unchanged Y/Y after a strong 2024e, with expected adj. EBIT growth of
~140% Y/Y on the back of previous capacity/automation investments. We expect
earnings to recover in 2026e and 2027e with annual EBIT growth of 26–32%. Net debt as
of Q3(24) was only SEK2m, excluding IFRS 16, which we expect to turn into net cash of
SEK14m by YE(24e) and SEK19m in 2025e. This is supported by ~SEK300m–340m in
OCF in 2024–25e, while FCF is much lower due to significant fulfilment centre
investments and a slight NWC build-up to 3.0% of sales in 2025e. Beyond 2025e, we
expect stronger FCF (post-leasing) of ~SEK340m–360m in 2026–27e.

Sales

Apotea aims for 2x sales in 4–5 years,
implying 2–6%-point outperformance
vs market

Apotea aims to double net sales over the next 4–5 years from ~SEK6bn in LTM Q3(24), per its
financial targets. This implies a sales CAGR of 15–19% in the next 4–5-year period, to be
achieved by capitalising on tailwinds from increased online penetration in the Swedish pharmacy
market, for which Arthur D. Little forecasts a 13% sales CAGR(24–28e). For Apotea to reach its
target, which implies above-market-growth (2–6%-points annual market outperformance), it will
focus on: 1) maintaining operational excellence; 2) expanding its Rx sales; and 3) growing in
Norway.
Sales increased strongly for Apotea during the pandemic (2020 and 2021) as more shopping
moved online, driving a steep increase in online penetration (2018: 8%; 2021: 19%, according to
Arthur D. Little). Sales in 2023 reached SEK5.5bn, up from SEK2.7bn in 2019 (pre pandemic),
increasing further in 2024 to SEK6.3bn LTM Q3(24). We expect this strong sales growth to
continue (14.5% sales CAGR(23–27e), reaching sales of ~SEK9.4bn in 2027e.

Apotea’s sales CAGR has declined over time, due to base effects and tougher comparisons after
rapid growth during the pandemic (2020–21). For 2023–27e we expect a sales CAGR of 14.5%,
due to higher Rx sales and increased online penetration, supported by more sales initiatives on
pricing and advertising as order fulfilment capacity increases with the Varberg fulfilment centre
investment.

Covid-related products likely boosted
sales, mainly in 2020–21, although
Apotea has not provided any indication
on the size

We believe Apotea sold a significant number of Covid-related items such as tests and protective
equipment that boosted sales 2020–21 (and the beginning of 2022), and likely created tough
comps for further sales growth in 2022–23. We believe this, coupled with less available warehouse
capacity in 2021–23, explains some of the lower sales growth in the period, and is the reason for
Apotea’s strategic decision to invest in more capacity and automation.

Limited seasonality for sales and
margins

We note that sales seasonality has been limited, albeit with a small increase in Q4 (Black Friday
in November and Christmas), particularly for ‘other products’ (OTC and TG, i.e. non-Rx).

Apotea’s sales increase has been nearly fully organic, as no direct sales currency-effects nor M&A
was meaningfully present prior to entering Norway during the autumn 2022 (sales of
~NOK110m in 2023) through an acquisition.
The sales growth pace was relatively low between Q2(22)–Q1(23) (and in Q4(21)), partly owing
to the fulfilment centre reaching its capacity. As a result, Apotea took over its co-tenants’ space
to expand its warehousing capacity further, and invested in more automated fulfilment to cater
for growth. This can be seen in higher sales growth since Q2(23,) when Apotea finalised its
investments in automation and capacity.

Lower sales growth at the end of the
pandemic due to a capacity

On a rolling twelve-month basis, Apotea has had gradual sales increases from quarter to quarter,
with a strong trajectory since Q2(23) and an increasing LTM growth rate up until Q2(24), which
we expect to gradually slow slightly in H2(24e)–H1(25e) due to tougher comps and higher
capacity utilisation. Once the Varberg fulfilment centre is opened in mid-2025 we expect sales
momentum to improve again from H2(25e).

For growth per business area, we expect Rx to grow the strongest, due to an increased focus from
Apotea, Varberg starting up (15 Rx seats initially, with 15 more possible) and further Rx personnel
recruitments. We go into further detail on Rx sales in the Growth Strategy and Financials – Key growth
drivers sections.
We also see strong growth among the important Other products area owing to greater online
penetration in the market, albeit still slightly below the group’s average sales growth. For Services,
which includes leasing and marketing contributions (paid by Apotea’s suppliers), which only
represented 2% of sales annually for Apotea in 2021-23. Looking forward, we expect modest,
below-group growth for Other products and Services, although with strong Services growth in
2024e owing to a strong H1(24) that we expect will be sustained.

Apotea

Key growth drivers

We see good potential for Apotea to continue its sales growth; supported by market tailwinds
and company initiatives to remain the market leader, improve Rx sales and grow in Norway,
which we go through in greater detail in the Growth strategy section of this report.
Sales growth mainly driven by orders,
but also by higher AOV

Apotea has grown at a 19% sales CAGR(19–23). We calculate that growth in the number of
orders has contributed ~13%-points, while an increasing average order value (AOV) explains
5.5%-points of the sales increase during this period. According to Apotekskollen, OTC prices
increased by 7.7% between June 2023 and August 2024, which is slightly above Apotea’s AOV
change. We note that Apotea’s AOV also benefits strongly from increased Rx sales.

We see an opportunity for Apotea to grow in pharmacy-related products that are sold in other
channels outside of pharmacies, a market that according to Arthur D. Little was worth SEK51bn
in 2023 (nearly as large as the SEK58bn total pharmacy channel, 2023). This assortment includes
products such as pet care/food, OTC and consumer health and beauty/personal care.
Different product mix vs overall
pharmacy-market; great potential to
grow Rx

Apotea has a different product sales split than the overall pharmacy-market as it has more OTC
& TG sales, but we expect Rx to increase as a percentage of sales going forward. According to a
sales channel analysis for 2022 conducted by TLV (Swedish Dental and Pharmaceutical Benefits
Agency), online players had ~50% of sales to Rx, 41% to TG and 9% to OTC; while for offline
players it was 77% Rx, 14% TG and 9% OTC. Apotea’s sales split is only 36% Rx (Q3(24) LTM),
representing a Rx market share of only 4%, which enables a long Rx growth runway. OTC
represents about 13% of sales, according to Apotea.

We expect Rx to grow faster than the group, driven by increased Rx capacity (mainly in Varberg,
which is due to ramp up from mid-2025 ahead of Black Friday), and from declining numbers of
offline pharmacies, which should make more pharmacists available for hire.

Rx sales per FTE (proxy for efficiency)
has increased during 2021–23

Apotea continues to optimise for Rx personnel sales efficiency, which we believe will lead to
increased sales per Rx personnel, from already high levels. Due to hiring timing effects, Rx sales
per Rx employee fell in 2022, but adjusted for this by using average Rx FTEs during a year, we
can see that Rx sales per employee has increased slightly, by a 3.4% CAGR(21-23), including price
increases.

An individual Rx product typically comes with lower gross margin than OTG/TG, but according
to Apotea Rx increases AOVs and decreases the delivery’s cost share per order due to generally
higher sales price. Hence, it has similar unit economics vs. non-Rx orders, despite a dilutive grossmargin (19-20%, vs ~27% for the group 2023). We also note that Apotea’s Rx sales is profitable,
while offline pharmacies typically have negative trade-margin from Rx (even before capital costs),
owing to a larger fixed cost base, according to a report from Sveriges Apoteksförening in 2018.
We note that Apotea, which has grown strongly within OTC and TG, has likely expedited the
decline in pharmacy estate (offline) by taking sales volumes from offline pharmacies, which are
necessary for them to cover costs through upselling.

Growth in Norway
We see the Norwegian opportunity as an interesting upside option for Apotea provided that it
does not dilute the company’s focus on its core Swedish market. By 2028, Arthur D. Little
estimates that online penetration could be 12%, versus 5% in 2023, which is well below the 21%
online penetration in Sweden currently, partly as the Norwegian market was demonopolized later
than the Swedish one.
In our sales forecast, we expect that Norway could grow to NOK390m by 2026e (representing
5% of group sales 2026e) if it were to grow sales at a similar Y/Y trajectory as Apotea managed
in 2016–18 (albeit from a higher sales base of ~SEK590m in 2015 for Apotea). We view our
estimates as conservative compared to what a fully successful expansion in Norway, like Apotea
in Sweden, would imply. In a blue-sky scenario, if we were to pencil in the same online penetration
as in Sweden (currently expected to rise to 31% by 2028 per Arthur D. Little), and Apotea’s
current market share (~45%), we find sales potential of NOK3.1bn for Apotera (see growth strategy
section).
According to Apotea, Apotera was close to break-even in 2023, at EBIT NOK-6m.

Building a highly automated Varberg
fulfilment centre, which adds 50% to
daily order capacity, ramping up from
mid-2025

Apotea

Capacity and automation
We like the new, highly automated Varberg fulfilment centre, which is set to launch in mid-2025.
In addition to increasing Apotea’s daily order capacity by ~50% to ~150,000, it should also bring
better unit economics due to its high automation. We view the Varberg fulfilment centre as
strategically well located to enable efficient and full geographical coverage. Its investment in
automation enables capacity growth and improved efficiency owing to the higher automation
(automation also for L and XL orders), in our view.

Consistent profitability and selffinanced expansion

Apotea has a history of consistent profitability and has therefore been able to self-finance its high
sales growth ever since it launched in 2012. However, while gross margins have been relatively
stable in recent years, EBIT margins have been volatile in its history, partly due to capacity
constraints, investments, and lowering product prices. The average EBIT margin was 2.6% in
2012–23, but has been volatile, ranging from 5.3% in 2021 to 1.0% in 2022, albeit partly due to
NRIs. We believe that the strong EBIT margin in H1(24) of 4.3% (up from 2.1% in H1(23))
suggests that Apotea can balance margins with sales growth if it wants.
Apotea targets a 7–8% EBIT margin in the “long-term”, versus 4.1% LTM Q3(24) adjusted.
Apotea expects this to be driven by ~2/3 gross margin improvements and ~1/3 opex
improvements. We note that Apotea does not include any pricing increases (above inflation) to
drive margins, as it wants to keep up the pressure on smaller and loss-making peers, we believe.

Gross margin potential from
procurement efficiencies and private
label expansion

The gross margin expansion can be divided into two areas: 1) procurement, and 2) private label.
For procurement, Apotea expects better purchasing prices from scale, collaboration with
suppliers (marketing contribution), and increased parallel import of Rx products (at ~10%
currently). Apotea aims to increase its portfolio of private label and its share of sales, which is
gross-margin accretive. As of June 2024, it had ~200 SKUs representing ~1% of net sales, while
its peer Apotek Hjärtat (owned by the food-retailer ICA) had a ~19% private label share of sales
in non-Rx products 2023.
Apotea has had stable and gradually improving absolute gross profit figures. However, the gross
margin has been volatile due to aggressive consumer pricing to extend its pricing lead versus
competitors (price study suggests 36% lower prices for Apotea than offline competitors, and
-11%-points cheaper than online peers, compared to the offline prices).

Gross margins higher in Service
(marketing contributions from
suppliers), but lower in Rx (GMs
regulated by TLV)

2024e

Source: Apotea (historical), Carnegie Research (estimates)

For gross margins per business area, we expect service to be clearly above the group, while Rx is
below the group. For Rx this is due to the regulated limit of ~19–20% in Sweden (set by the
TLV), although the higher AOVs when including Rx makes unit economics similar to the Other
products business area, and parallel imports (which Apotea wants to increase from ~10%
currently) can support somewhat higher Rx gross margins than the 20% upper limit, with positive
effects from bulk discounts and supplier kick-backs. We also note that TLV during spring 2024
made its largest ever increase in Rx pricing (positive for Apotea) due to inflation. We estimate
gross margins in business area Other products (OTC & TG) to gradually increase during 2024–
27e but to remain close to 30–31%.
We understand that gross margins within Services are higher as this area includes marketing
contributions from suppliers, which do not carry any significant additional costs for Apotea.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Apotea says that it benefits relative to competitors from regulated “low” Rx gross margins as
these regulations make it relatively tough for competitors with lower efficiency, and that Apotea’s
Rx sales are profitable, while this is not always the case for competitors. Offline pharmacies
typically have negative margins from Rx (even before capital costs), owing to a larger fixed cost
base, according to a report from Sveriges Apoteksförening in 2018.

For Apotea in general, gross margin improvements are driven by scale, product mix and
marketing contribution from suppliers.
While the absolute gross profit has been relatively stable, the interim Y/Y gross margin
development since 2021 has been volatile partly due to: 1) product mix, 2): market sentiment and
competitive dynamics (e.g. competitors' campaigns); and 3) Apotea’s pricing strategy to extend
its discounted-pricing-lead versus competitors (price study suggests 36% lower prices for Apotea

than offline competitors, and -11%-points cheaper than online peers, compared to the offline
prices).

Gross margin vs. selected peers

We also note that for Rx, Apotea’s sourcing from its supplier (e.g. Oriola in Enköping) has no
freight cost, and that nearly all of Apotea’s purchases are in SEK currency for Sweden and NOK
for Norway.
Gross margins in H1(24) were 27.5% for Apotea, which is above the European online pharmacies
Redcare and DocMorris, at 23.4% and 21.6%, respectively, according to company information.

EBIT has been volatile and low, predominantly in 2022, when pandemic demand waned and
Apotea was struggling from high capacity-utilisation and subsequent opex and capex investments
in increased capacity and automation. This led to higher growth in opex than sales, while gross
margins were kept stable at 26.0% (-0.1%-point Y/Y in 2022).

Volatile EBIT historically, e.g. in 2022
due to reaching high capacityutilisation levels

Government support increased EBIT by SEK6m in 2022, and ~SEK2m in 2023, according to
Apotea’s annual report for 2023.
Apotea has posted very strong EBIT numbers for all three quarters so far in 2024, partly as the
gross margin expanded ~1.9%-points Y/Y in Q2(24), and opex growth was significantly lower
than the strong sales growth. During Q2(23) Apotea finalised its investments in automation and
capacity in Morgongåva, which has resulted in strong EBIT development since.

Adjustments: Apotea has historically had very small adjustments to reported EBIT, besides
SEK-14m in 2021, and SEK-3m in H1(24), related to change in ownership preparations. We also
assume SEK-16m in change in ownership costs for Q4(24e), in addition to the SEK-6m in
Q3(24).

Y/Y growth in sales fluctuated in 2022–23, with a significant opex increase in H2(22) due to
capacity increases resulting in higher sales growth, with a small delay. Likewise, a period of high
sales growth at Apotea leads to a subsequent period of higher opex growth. If capacity utilisation
is very high, as it was in 2022, opex rises as a result of increased weekend-work and more nightstaffing, which are both more expensive than normal day-staffing.

Sales growth

Apotea’s incremental margin (defined as Y/Y change in EBIT vs Y/Y change in sales) has
historically been in the single digits (2014–19), but turned negative in 2021–22 due to capacity
increases. These capacity increases have yielded good results as the incremental margin rose
significantly in 2023 and Q1–Q3(24), a trend we expect to continue into Q4(24) as well, albeit at
a lower level. In 2025, we are more conservative on margins due to Varberg ramping up from
mid-2025. Over time, the Varberg fulfilment centre investment should drive incremental margins
higher due to better unit economics from its higher fixed cost base, as it is more automated than
Morgongåva centre. We also expect Apotea’s low-cost mindset throughout the organisation to
support operating leverage.

Strong EBITDA growth 2023–27e,
unhampered by Varberg-related D&A

Apotea

EBITDA
We expect Apotea’s EBITDA to rise significantly in our forecast period (2024–27e) as a result of
increased EBIT, but also as we see D&A increasing due to Varberg, a SEK350m–380m
investment that Apotea expects will be depreciated over five years, i.e. SEK70m–76m per full
year. This leads to a gradually improving EBITDA margin, from 4% in 2021 to above 7% in
2026–27e. According to Apotea, IFRS 16 reduced EBITDA by SEK28m in 2021, SEK34m in
2022, and SEK44m in 2023. For 2024–27e we forecast the IFRS 16 effect at ~SEK50m–90m
due to increased rental costs, e.g. from Varberg.

Apotea

Balance sheet
Apotea is asset-light, with limited
maintenance capex and a low working
capital-to-sales ratio

Apotea is asset-light, with limited maintenance capex, a low working capital-to-sales ratio and
high return on capital (average ROCE 2023–27e: 26%). This is important as it makes it easier to
grow without requiring significant capital over time. Currently, Apotea is investing its proceeds
into automation and expanding its fulfilment centre, including the ongoing investment in its
second fulfilment centre, in Varberg, completed mid-2025.
The balance sheet featured ~SEK1.5bn per Q3(24) in total assets. The assets mainly consisted of
working capital items, with inventory and receivables at ~SEK870m, i.e. 58% of assets combined.
PPE was SEK335m, related to its fulfilment operations and automation (the automation
equipment is fully owned by Apotea), which is depreciated linearly over five years. Right of use
assets (IFRS 16) include fulfilment centre facilities, offices, solar panels, and air purifiers.

37% equity ratio per Q3(24)
Net debt excl. IFRS16 close to zero

High capex/sales 2024–25e, falling to
below 2% in 2026–27e as near-term
cash flows are reinvested into Varberg

Equity & liabilities also mainly consist of working capital items, with payables at ~SEK560m, and
equity also at ~SEK560m excluding for minority owners (37% equity ratio, adjusted for untaxed
reserves). The long-term liabilities of ~SEK130m are mostly related to leasing debt (IFRS 16).
Net debt amounts to SEK173m incl. IFRS16 (leasing) and net debt excl. IFRS16 amounts to
SEK2m.
Looking forward, we expect PPE and leasing assets/liabilities to increase in 2024–25e due to
investments in Varberg automation and rental agreements for the building. Apotea expects total
capex in Varberg of SEK350m–380m in 2024–25. Besides expansion capex, Apotea considers its
maintenance capex needs as low, which is why we expect total capex to fall to below 2% of sales
in 2026–27e.
We expect a small net cash position in 2024–25e (excl. IFRS 16) despite nearly all its cash flows
being reinvested in Varberg as capex. However, we expect the new fulfilment centre to increase
Apotea’s leasing liabilities. For 2026e, we expect net cash of ~SEK380m, which would likely
enable significant dividends.

Working capital
During 2021–23, net working capital (NWC) ranged between ~SEK100m–140m. The NWC’s
main components are inventories, receivables, and payables.
In 2022, SEK21m of the working capital increase (of SEK39m) was related to Apotera in
Norway.
Looking forward, we expect working capital to remain close to 2–2.5% of sales in FY 2024e and
2026–27e. For 2025e we expect Varberg to increase group inventory levels, leading to slightly
higher WC/sales at 3%, similar to what happened in 2022 when it reached 2.8% of sales.

No significant NWC seasonality

15 January 2025

Apotea’s working capital has no clear seasonality other than being slightly higher ahead of Black
Friday and Christmas (Q4). Historically, working capital swings have rather been affected by
changes in demand for specific products (pandemic and war-induced) and fulfilment centre
capacity constraints.

A significant share of NWC is reimbursements of health benefits (Sv: “Högkostnadsskydd”) from
Swedish’ TLV, which is paid out at the beginning of the following month. This creates a buildup effect each month in accounts receivables.
The reimbursement-to-sales ratio was stable at 4.2–4.4% of sales in 2021–23, which we expect
will continue in 2024–26e. At year-end 2021–23, non-paid reimbursements represented SEK191–
242m of Apotea’s working capital in the same period.

Days inventory outstanding (DIO) increased slightly in 2023 to 41 days, versus 38 days in 2021–
22, due to fulfilment centre expansion in Morgongåva which in 2023 made it possible to store
more goods so as to secure good availability of pharmacy products to customers. We expect DIO
to remain close to 2023 levels in 2024–27e, apart from an increase in 2025 due to Varberg. Days
payable outstanding (DPO) remained above DIO in 2021–23, which helps lowering working
capital. This has been supported by improved supplier payment terms, according to Apotea.

Apotea has a good inventory turnover ratio as a result of efficient inventory management and
ability to sell stocked goods. Despite a demanding macro environment and external factors
(pandemic and war), the inventory turnover ratio stayed flat at 9.0–9.6x over 2021–23. We expect
inventories to increase in absolute terms and for inventory turnover to come down slightly due
to ramp up of another fulfilment centre, Varberg, from mid-2025.

Per 2023 the financial leverage was 0.2x NIBD/EBITDA (excl. IFRS 16). We expect the Varberg
investment to increase Apotea’s leasing liabilities (fulfilment centre rent) from mid-2025, and for
which it guides ~SEK20m per year in rental costs. For FY(25e) we expect a net cash position of
~SEK20m excluding leasing debt, and net debt of ~SEK330m including leasing, representing
ND/EBITDA(25e) of 0.0x to +0.7x excluding/including IFRS 16. In 2026e we expect a
significantly greater net cash position due to strong free cash flow generation as investments are
lower, working capital normalised and earnings higher.

Cash flow
We expect low FCF in 2024–25e, but
above SEK300m annually in 2026–27e
once its investments are completed.
We expect dividends from FY2026e
(paid in spring 2027)

Apotea has been able to self-fund its growth, including expansion investments, through constant
profitability and an asset-light business model with high returns on capital. However, it is
currently investing in its second automated fulfilment centre in Varberg, which is guided by
Apotea to cost a total of SEK350m–380m in (expansionary) capex in 2024-25e. We expect free
cash flow after capex (including maintenance and expansion capex) and leasing expenses to
remain relatively low (albeit still positive) in 2024–25e, but above SEK300m annually in 2026–
27e once its investments are completed. Looking beyond 2025, as a consequence of less capex
and higher earnings we see room for significant dividend payments, well above what Apotea has
distributed historically.

High capex 2024–25e is related to
Varberg

Very low intangible capex

Apotea

Tangible capex was ~SEK80m–140m in 2021–23, related to automation investments in
Morgongåva. We expect capex to peak in 2024–25 (~SEK460m combined, including
maintenance) mainly related to its new, highly automated Varberg fulfilment centre. In 2022,
SEK19m of capex was related to Apotera in Norway.
Apotea’s IT spend has been recognised as opex rather than intangible capex, as is evident from
its minuscule intangible investments (SEK0–1m annually in 2021–23), which we expect will
remain the case going forward.

Thanks to its strong sales growth Apotea has invested significantly in PPE historically, as is
evident from the higher capex than D&A. From 2026 and beyond we pencil in lower capex, while
D&A increases due to the prior investments.

Apotea has a decent track-record of dividends since fiscal year (FY) 2016, despite its significant
fulfilment centre expansion/automation investments historically. For FY 2019 the dividend was
paused due to the pandemic, and in 2020–23 Apotea prioritised capex over hiked dividends.
Looking forward, we expect a pay-out ratio of 25% of net profit in FY 2026–27e (i.e. first
payment in H1(27e)) once the investment period is completed.

Apotea

Financial targets

Apotea’s ambitions over the next 4–5 years are for substantial sales growth while maintaining
healthy profitability and distributing any surplus capital to shareholders. We expect surplus capital
to increase significantly from FY 2026e and onward once the Varberg fulfilment centre is
operational, which we forecast to result in dividends.
Sales growth driven by online
penetration, Rx and Norway

Sales – Apotea aims to double net sales over the next 4–5 years from the LTM Q3(24) levels of
~SEK6bn, per its financial targets. This implies a sales CAGR of 15–19% during the next 4–5
years. This is to be achieved by capitalising on tailwinds from increased online penetration in the
Swedish pharmacy market, which Arthur D. Little expects to experience a 13% sales CAGR(2428). For Apotea to reach its target, which implies above-market growth (2–6%-points of annual
market outperformance) it plans to focus on: 1) maintaining operational excellence; 2) expanding
its Rx sales, and 3) growing in Norway.
For 2023–27e we expect a sales CAGR of 14.5%, owing to higher Rx sales, increased online
penetration, and more sales-initiatives on pricing and commercials as order fulfilment capacity
increases with the Varberg fulfilment centre investment.

Margin potential, mainly from higher
gross margins

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Dividend potential from FY2026e

Margin – Apotea targets a 7–8% EBIT margin in the “long-term” (5–10 years, we believe), versus
4.1% LTM Q3(24) adjusted for NRI and 4.4% in H1(24). Apotea expects this long-term uplift to
be driven by ~2/3 gross margin improvements and ~1/3 opex improvements. For the coming
years, we expect good momentum throughout 2024e, but with no adj. EBIT growth in 2025e
owing to ramp-up costs and initially low utilisation in Varberg H2(25e), as well as margin-dilutive
growth in Norway, which in 2023 was slightly below break-even, while Apotea simultaneously
keeps prices low to squeeze loss-making competitors. We believe that its strong EBIT margin
recently suggests that Apotea can balance margins and sales growth, if it makes this a priority. We
forecast a 4.3% adjusted EBIT margin in 2024e, dropping to 3.8% in 2025e, and improving to
4.4–4.9% in 2026–27e.
Dividend – The main capital allocation focus for Apotea is to drive profitable growth, but any
surplus may still be distributed to shareholders. We expect FCF to remain relatively low in 2024–
25e, due to expansionary capex, but with a strong improvement in free cash generation in 2026e
that would allow for dividends. Going forward, we expect dividends from FY(26e) with a payout ratio of 25% of net profit in FY 2026–27e once the investment period is completed.

Q3(24) results

Apotea reported a solid Q3, continuing to build on its momentum with high sales growth,
improving margins and solid cash flow, albeit affected by a WC build-up and the Varberg
investment. Looking ahead, Apotea notes that it will launch several new own brands in
Q4 and during next year, but that Q4 comps are tough and that the black week sales are
expected to impact gross margin and costs. Q4 will also include further NRIs.
Sales growth of 18% Y/Y, lifted by Rx
sales and more SKUs

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

LTM sales SEK6.3bn

Apotea grew Q3 sales to SEK1,625m, representing 18.0% net sales growth Y/Y, despite now
facing tougher comps (+20.5% Y/Y in Q3(23)). According to the company, this was driven by
operational excellence and increased Rx sales. In the quarter, it signed nearly 30 new pharmacists
(says management) which will begin gradually over the next months, and should be supportive
for further Rx sales growth, where Apotea currently has a lower market share than the total
Swedish market. Rx sales grew by 22% Y/Y, and Apotea expects Rx to drive further growth for
the group, as clients typically find its wider assortment, attractive prices and fast deliveries
appealing. For Other products, sales grew 14.6% Y/Y. Apotea also celebrated its 12-year
anniversary in September, with a campaign which resulted in ~SEK100m in sales. LTM sales is
now SEK6.3bn, vs SEK5.5bn in FY2023 (21.4% CAGR). Per Q3(24), the number of SKUs has
increased to 52,000, partly due to expanding the assortment within Beauty.

EBIT +215% Y/Y, supported by higher

operating leverage

Healthy cash flows, albeit hampered by
higher NWC levels Y/Y and Varberg
investments.
ND/EBITDA (excl. IFRS16) now 0.0x.

Adj. EBIT grew to SEK82m, adjusted for SEK5.7m in listing costs in Q3. This is up considerably
Y/Y (215%) from the Q3(23) levels of SEK26m. In addition to sales growth, the strong adj.
EBIT margin increase from 1.9% to 5.1% is due to operating leverage (scalability on opex) and
higher gross margins (+1.5%-points Y/Y, to 27.3%). Apotea notes that cost inflation had a
negative gross margin effect in 9M(23) which had been neutralised in 9M(24), supported by active
procurement efforts, assortment optimisation and supplier collaborations. D&A remained
unchanged Y/Y at 2.0% of sales in Q3 (the Varberg investment is expected by Apotea and us to
be depreciated from Q3(25)). Personnel costs in Q3(24) declined to 7.6% of sales (-1.7%-points
Y/Y) and average FTEs declined by 134 Y/Y (mostly due to outsourced staffing within
fulfilment).
Cash flow was solid in Q3, mostly driven by higher earnings Y/Y albeit NWC increased to 3.5%
(2.6% Q3(23)) of LTM sales which brought operating cash flow to SEK55m, vs SEK83m in
Q3(23). However, cash earnings (prior to the SEK79m WC delta Y/Y, with a release last year
and an inventory build-up & payables decline Q3(24)) more than doubled to SEK95.5m (44.2m).
Capex in Q3(24) was low at SEK6m, but we expect it to be high in coming quarters due to
Varberg.
The balance sheet strengthened to a net debt (excl. IFRS16) of just SEK2m. Inventory turnover
reached 9.2x (9.7x). Apotea also notes that it is on track to go live with the Varberg expansion in
Summer 2025.

Sustainability
Sustainability is a core part of Apotea’s business model and its brand ambitions. As a
retailer of pharmaceuticals and products related to health and well-being, it is key for
Apotea to be viewed as a reliable brand as well as being a ‘good citizen’. The company
has two key aims: to become the largest pharmacy in Sweden, and to become Sweden’s
most sustainable company. It has published extensive sustainability reporting since 2018
and has a clear aim to deliver on the Paris Agreement science-based targets to limit the
group’s impact on the environment. The company has also for many years engaged in
charity work. We believe continued ESG work is core for Apotea to further strengthen its
brand, as well as to avoid ESG related risks.

Key efforts to reduce delivery
emissions and plastic packaging

Code of conduct signed by 89% of
suppliers

Sustainability as a business driver
Apotea’s key sustainability efforts include switching from individual diesel-powered transport by
its delivery providers to transporting all deliveries through its own (leased), mostly electrified,
vehicles, which run from its fulfilment centre in Morgongåva to all its fulfilment providers’
terminals in Rosersberg, north of Stockholm, thus significantly reducing both the number of
vehicles and their emissions. The company has also worked to reduce the amount of plastic
packaging in its incoming products, with the aim of not only helping to reduce the environmental
impact but also to reduce the man-hours required to unpack deliveries at its fulfilment centre.
Apotea launched a code of conduct in 2021, which by 2023 had been signed by 89% of its
suppliers. The company aims to have all its suppliers and partners sign the code of conduct by
2025.

Sustainability targets and achievements
Most of Apotea’s CO2 emissions are related to scope 3, where total emissions amounted to
119,000 tonnes of CO2 in 2023. As a retailer mainly of external brands, Apotea has rather limited
means to reduce them, but has clear aims to reduce emissions related to transport, which it has
already cut by 22% since 2020. It aims for another 24% reduction by 2025.
Solar panels at fulfilment nearly
sufficient to match energy utilisation

The Morgongåva fulfilment centre was built with a geothermal energy system and has roofmounted solar power with total capacity of 2.3MW. This is one of the largest roof-mounted solar
power plants in the Nordics and makes the Morgongåva fulfilment centre nearly self-sufficient in
terms of energy utilisation.
For many years, Apotea has engaged in extensive charity work. Since it was launched in 2012, the
company has contributed around SEK125m to various charity foundations, including
contributions from customers (e.g. rounding-up the purchasing price) and sales of products
where all or part of the proceeds have gone to charity. Among its key initiatives the company has
sent medical supplies worth over SEK20m to Ukraine, and has donated to causes including SOS
Barnbyar, Barncancerfonden, Skärgårdsstiftelsen and the Worldwide Fund for Nature.

Employees
Apotea aims to create a strong corporate culture based on openness, consideration, effectiveness,
innovation and sustainability. New employees are given a compact handbook that highlights these
ambitions while also pointing to the company’s key missions, guidelines and the recipe behind its
success.
In 2023, Apotea had an average of 862 employees, all of whom had collective wage agreements
(except the CEO). Staff turnover was around 10% and the gender distribution was mostly equal
between men and women. Some 59% of all employees were male; 73% of all employees in
distribution were male while 79% of all pharmacists were female. The CEO and CFO are both
male, but women make up around 44% of the management team and board of directors.
Sustainability-related risks and past incidents
Sustainability risks include workplace safety, energy use, emissions, and logistics. We believe it
will be key for Apotea to continue to limit the environmental impact related to the transport of
goods to and from Apotea’s fulfilment centres, but also to ensure data security and privacy
concerns, as the company stores large amounts of personal data. Apotea has no production of its
own, but there is risk that its external brands may not fully comply with Apotea’s own guidelines.

High satisfaction and limited turnover
among employees

78

We have been unable to find any major sustainability-related incidents in its past. We have noted
that Apotea has been accused (no ongoing dispute) on several occasions of poor working
conditions at its fulfilment centre, including accusations of excessive use of overtime, harassment,
and camera monitoring of employees. Still our impression is that these accusations do not differ
much from other fulfilment centres and the media attention related to these appears to have been
limited in the past year. Employee turnover is low (~10% annually) and Apotea’s employee
surveys show high scores on all parameters (>70 on a scale of 0 to 100, suggesting good work
environment).

Apotea

Key risks
Below, we highlight some of the key risks that could affect the performance and valuation of
Apotea. This is not intended to represent a comprehensive list of the risks that the company may
face, but rather includes those risks that we find most relevant. For a more complete list, please
see the company’s prospectus.
Margin outlook
Unlike many of its peers, Apotea has been profitable from its first year of operations and its
expansion has been almost fully self-funded. Even so, its operating margin is low and has been
rather volatile on both an annual and quarterly basis. In the past four years, Apotea’s margin has
fluctuated from an operating loss of 0.9% in Q4(22) to an operating profit of 5.1% in Q3(24),
and its average margin since 2013 has been around 2.6%. The company targets an EBIT margin
of at least 3–5% in the short- to medium term, and 7–8% longer term, which we think refers to
a period within 5–10 years. By Q3(24), the company had already achieved an adjusted margin of
5.1%, or 4.1% LTM, which suggests to us that the medium-term target is already well proven.
But the longer-term margin target has never been achieved and will likely require significant scale
effects as well as gradually reduced investments in growth.
Varberg fulfilment centre
Apotea’s launch of a second fulfilment centre, in Varberg in Southern Sweden, from mid-2025 is
key for the group to establish sufficient capacity for continued strong growth. But the transition
from one fulfilment centre to two will likely trigger some additional costs, temporarily lower
capacity utilisation at both fulfilment centre, and higher depreciation charges. Major changes in
the fulfilment process also always entail a slight risk of temporary disruptions. If these were to be
severe, Apotea’s near-term earnings could be hampered significantly.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Expansion to Norway and Finland
In November 2022, Apotea acquired a majority stake in Norwegian company Apotera (~59%
per 2023) and a 10.6% stake in Finnish Apomera. The former is a small challenger in the
Norwegian market, while the latter is even smaller and still lacks a licence to sell Rx and OTC
pharmaceuticals due to continued tight regulation of the Finnish market. Both generated minor
operating losses in 2023 (<SEK10m each), but although we believe Apotera is approaching
break-even, we believe Apomera is less mature and may take longer to get there. We have assumed
limited sales contribution from these two assets in the years ahead, but acknowledge that a
potential ramp-up of investments for either of these players could require further capital infusion
from Apotea. Similarly, if either business were to be closed or significantly revalued, it could
trigger a write-down (of goodwill). For Finland the value of the investment in shares sits at
SEK7.7m.
Increased competition
Apotea has been an early mover and established a clear market-leading position in Sweden. Its
combination of fast, convenient and free delivery options, low prices and yet consistent
profitability imply significant moats that we believe have made it difficult for new players to
compete. Even so, there is plenty of competition online, both from online-only retailers (Meds
and Apohem) and from store-based peers (e.g. Apoteket, Hjärtat). Despite Apotea’s clear market
lead, we believe competition may increase over time, not least from the incumbents that stand to
lose most from online migration. If peers were to push their prices lower in an attempt to catch
up, we believe Apotea may likely be inclined to follow, which may cause margin pressure.
Cyclicality
Demand for pharmaceutical products tends to be stable over time, suggesting attractive defensive
qualities. For example, the Swedish pharmacy market reported stable 3.2% sales CAGR(07–10),
showing no sign of any impact from the financial crisis. Even so, we believe Apotea’s exposure
to cyclicality may be somewhat greater than for traditional pharmacy retailers, partly due to its
relatively higher share of traded goods, but also to what we believe may be slightly greater
variations in demand for online sales and a more extensive use of campaigns to drive demand.

Apotea

Limited financial disclosure
Most of the online peers that we have used in our valuation comparison have been listed for
many years, so there is plenty of access to historical financial data, including quarterly results,
recorded conference calls, capital markets days, updated management statements, and financial
guidance. Unlike its peers, Apotea has provided rather limited financial data; detailed historical
figures are available only since 2021, there are few quarterly balance sheet or cash flow details.
This makes it a bit more difficult for investors to judge the validity of the company’s guidance
and to predict both the near-term and long-term outlook.
Cyber-security
Retailers in general, and online retailers in particular, are exposed to cyber-security risks. In recent
years there has been a growing prevalence of cyber-attacks on corporations and government
agencies, sometimes merely to create severe disruptions, but mostly in an attempt to force big
corporations to pay costly ransom fees. Cyberattacks are sensitive both for operations but also
because online retailers have significant customer data that could be sensitive if leaked externally.
Apotea has extensive routines in place for cybersecurity. All key infrastructure is proprietarily
developed for the company, all data is kept safe and restricted, with an isolated back-up to enable
a quick restart if its IT platform were to be compromised. Even so, we argue that cybersecurity
does pose a key operational risk.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Regulation
Selling pharmaceutical products online implies a highly regulated environment. This implies a
rather significant moat that could prevent new competition from entering the market, but it could
also lead to significant disruptions if regulation were to change. For instance, Läkemedelsverket
grants and monitors pharmacy licences and oversees parallel imports; eHälsomyndigheten
controls the database of electronic prescriptions; and TLV (the dental and pharmaceutical
benefits agency) regulates pharmaceutical pricing based on a mark-up between the wholesale price
paid by pharmacies and the sales price they charge their customers. Regulatory changes, such as
changes in mark-ups, restrictions in sales of certain products and/or a decision to limit or – worse
– fully withdraw a licence to sell pharmaceuticals could impact Apotea’s operations, potentially
severely.
For instance, there is an ongoing matter at the Swedish Medical Products Agency regarding a
regulatory change for online purchases of pharmacy products, where Apotea has been vocal in
commenting on the proposal. The issue is related to if it should be allowed to deliver products
purchased online to the customer’s unlocked mailbox or doorstep, where the item could get
stolen (“easy to grab” (Swe: lätt greppbart)”), which could potentially lead to prescribed products
getting in the wrong hands. Apotea has worked with the regulatory body and the company’s best
assumption as of November 2024 is that this would have only a small effect on costs and volumes,
as most deliveries could get rerouted through various methods and delivered in other ways, also
as the shipping companies is incentivised to deliver the order. We note that Apotea has also
mentioned that it already has ID control requirements at home-delivery for more sensitive
products, such as certain Rx products or some other more expensive products.
GDPR
The Swedish Authority for Privacy Protection (IMY) has since 2022 investigated Apotea and two
other pharmacies. This is related to the processing of personal data (GDPR) that was shared to
an external provider of targeted digital marketing. The three pharmacies reported themselves to
IMY. The other two pharmacies excluding Apotea have received fines. In December 2024,
Apotea’s matter at IMY was concluded with only a reprimand, i.e. without a sanction fee). We
note that GDPR fines could be up to 4% of a company’s global sales, but for the other two
pharmacies the fine was considerably less.

Disclosures and disclaimers
Carnegie Investment Bank AB

Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ.) is a leading investment bank with a Nordic focus. The Carnegie group of companies, together “Carnegie”, generates added value for institutions, companies and private clients in the
areas of trade in securities, investment banking and private banking. Carnegie has approximately 600 employees, located in offices in six countries

Ratings and risk assessment structure

Current rating system as of October 2011
Buy (B), upside of at least 10% to the target price and with an attractive risk/reward profile
Hold (H), neutral risk/reward profile or the stock is trading relatively near its target price
Sell (S), unattractive risk/reward profile and the stock is trading above its target price
Not rated (NR), Under review (UR), Under bid (UB). The investment rating, if any, has been suspended
temporarily.
Ratings may from time to time deviate from the definitions above owing to market volatility. Any such deviation
will be assessed regularly to determine whether it should no longer be considered temporary.
Risk assessment
The risk assessment is based on the analyst’s evaluation of the company’s equity beta based on the business risk
(asset beta) and financial risk (gearing).
Low risk estimated equity beta <0.75
Medium risk estimated equity beta 0.75 to 1.25
High risk estimated equity beta >1.25
Quantitative and technical analysis
Carnegie produces research based on quantitative and technical analysis (“quant products”). Such research is
based on mathematical and technical models applied to companies, industries and sectors, rather than a
fundamental analysis of a company. Quantitative and technical analysis thus does not result in estimates, a valuation
or a recommendation (e.g. Buy, Sell, Hold). Quant products may also have a significantly different time horizon
than those of other products generated by Carnegie. The views expressed in quant products may thus differ
from, or conflict with, other research generated by Carnegie.

Valuation, methodology, and assumptions

Target Price
Carnegie publishes a target price for most of the stocks in our Research Universe. The target price is the analyst’s
assessment of expected total return over the coming six to 12 months based on various fundamental valuation
methods. A commonly used method is DCF valuation, where future cash flows are discounted to today. Analysts
may also use different valuation multiples, e.g. P/E ratio and EV/EBIT multiples, relative to industry peers to obtain
a target price. For companies where it is appropriate, a target price can also be based on the analyst's assessment
of a fair ratio relative to the net asset value of the company. Target prices are revised when earnings and cash
flow forecasts are changed. Thus, changes to estimates are a key risk to the target price. Other reasons for
revising target prices include changes in the underlying value of a company's assets and when factors affecting the
required rate of return change, which can also be seen as risk factors to the target price.
Information
You will find detailed information about the valuation or methodology, the underlying assumptions, and risks on
Carnegie Edge (www.carnegie-edge.com). The complete history of research reports and previous
recommendations can also be found on Carnegie Edge.
