Playing to win
Asmodee, a leading global publisher and distributor, primarily of tabletop
games, operates a portfolio of more than 400 IPs and 950 games, supported by
licensing and distribution partnerships with top-tier IPs and entertainment
companies. Its first-class IP portfolio and widespread distribution network have
paved the way for a sales CAGR of 19% since 2015. We argue that Asmodee is
well positioned to continue to outgrow the market, owing to its evergreen
brand portfolio, established partnerships, and the fact that it is the only global
player that both publishes internal games and distributes third-party games.
Thus, we estimate that Asmodee will deliver organic sales and adjusted EBIT
CAGRs of ~6% and ~10%, respectively, through 2027/28, with clear upside
potential from value-accretive M&A. We initiate coverage with a Buy
recommendation and a multiples-based target price of SEK 118.

A market leader in a defensive, yet growing, market

Asmodee's vast catalogue of fully-owned (Ticket to Ride, Catan, 7 Wonders)
and partnered IPs (Star Wars, Disney, Marvel), alongside its distribution
network, which covers all retail channels across more than 100 countries, has
enabled Asmodee to become a global champion, as we see it. Today, it ranks
among the top three players in the US, the UK, France and Germany, which
together represent 65% of the global market. The tabletop games market has
proven resilient across cycles and is projected to grow by 4% per year until
2028. We argue that Asmodee is primed to continue outgrowing the market
and we expect an organic sales CAGR of ~6% through 2027/28.

Set to deliver at least a 10% adjusted EBIT CAGR through 2027/28

A stronger top line, a higher share of games published by Asmodee (which are
twice as profitable as distributed games) and scalability should all lift the
adjusted EBIT margin by 185bp from 2023/24 to 2027/28E, driving an adjusted
EBIT CAGR of ~10%. With a capex-light business model (2% of sales), we argue
that Asmodee is set to deliver underlying FCF margins of 10%, enabling M&A
ahead. In our M&A scenario, we argue the company could add 4-18% to basecase 2025/26E-27/28E EBITDA, leading to a 16% adjusted EBIT CAGR through
2027/28E, in such a scenario. Currently trading at a 30% discount to peers on
2025E EV/EBIT, we see now as the time to buy into a compelling long-term
story. Our target price of SEK 118 corresponds to 2025/26E EV/adjusted EBIT of
~14x, a 20% discount to key international and Nordic consumer goods peers.

Asmodee does not own any production and outsources this to partners on

Asmodee

Investment case
Asmodee is a leading global publisher and distributor, primarily of tabletop games. It operates
23 fully-owned studios around the world, with a portfolio of more than 400 IPs and 950 games,
supported by licensing and distribution partnerships with top-tier IPs and entertainment
companies. Asmodee's first-rate IP portfolio, vast distribution network and selective past
acquisitions have all paved the way to a sales CAGR of 19% since 2015, clearly outperforming
the market. We argue that Asmodee is well positioned to continue to outgrow the market,
thanks to its owned evergreen brand portfolio, established partnerships with global leading IPs,
heightened exposure to the fastest-growing subsegments, and the fact that it is the only global
player that both publishes internal games and distributes third-party games. Thus, we estimate
that Asmodee will deliver organic sales and adjusted EBIT CAGRs of ~6% and ~10%,
respectively, through 2027/28, with clear upside potential once it reactivates its value-accretive
M&A agenda. We initiate coverage with a Buy recommendation and a multiples-based target
price of SEK 118.

Investment case in brief
Four reasons to invest: a
resilient market, stellar
portfolio, attractive exposure
and strong distribution
network

Tabletop games are resilient
and set for growth – the highly
fragmented market is ideal for
a consolidator like Asmodee

Asmodee is a top-three player
in the key global geographies

We argue that Asmodee is primed to continue to outgrow the market. Our investment
case therefore rests on four main pillars: 1) presence in a resilient and structurallygrowing market; 2) the portfolio: clear potential to capitalise on flagship franchises and
develop new games that build on renowned names; 3) attractive exposure to the
fastest-growing segments; 4) the ability to leverage its unique distribution network.

1) The market

Asmodee operates in the structurally-growing tabletop games market, which has
defensive characteristics and has demonstrated resilience across cycles, as it managed
to grow during both during the global financial crisis and the COVID-19 years. The
market enjoyed a surge in popularity during the latter period (2019-21 mass-market
sales CAGR of 19%). Yet, even after the massive boost during that time, the market has
continued to grow organically (4% in 2021-24), driven by customer loyalty, a diversified
mix of board games and trading card games (TCG), broader distribution and wider
game variety. Looking ahead, mass-market sales are set to deliver a CAGR of 4%
through 2027/28E, according to a market study by consultancy Arthur D. Little. Given
that the market remains highly fragmented, we see plenty of untapped opportunities
ahead.
Asmodee has a track record of outgrowing the market. Since 2015, it has delivered a
sales CAGR of 19%. Today, the company ranks in the top three market leaders in the
key geographies of the US, France, Germany and the UK, which together represent
~65% of the global market.

Expansions and ancillary
products keep evergreen IPs
relevant

Asmodee

2) The portfolio

We envision Asmodee continuing to capitalise on its evergreen IPs. Asmodee's
catalogue also includes high-potential IPs across more than 100 games with diéerent
game styles, attracting a wide range of consumers. Here, Asmodee aims to grow its
household name IPs, such as Catan, Ticket To Ride and 7 Wonders, by raising brand
awareness through marketing and expanding the game catalogue, driven by
expansions, licenced products and complementary products. This, coupled with
improved retail channels, and expanding its portfolio into digital formats, should
broaden the potential target audience.

Innovation happens at the 23
in-house studios and via
collaborations to add new
games

5

Alongside Asmodee's commitment to legacy games, it is also on the hunt for new
products, many of which are developed by its 23 in-house studios. We understand that
the company aims to expand its portfolio through a combination of internal innovation
and strategic collaborations to add new games and solidify its position as a market
leader. Examples of such initiatives are the recently successful trading card release of
Star Wars: Unlimited and the board game Monkey Place, in collaboration with Lego,
both of which we expect to drive long revenue tails. Thanks to Asmodee's extensive
distribution network, studios can react to local trends and rapidly evolve in response to
emerging phenomena to create the sorts of games in demand by end customers.

6 March 2025

A tilt to the social and strategy
segments is favourable

Asmodee

3) Exposure: The segments and mix

We view Asmodee's exposure towards the fastest-growing segments as attractive.
According to the same market study conducted by Arthur D. Little, the social and
strategy game segments are expected to yield the fastest growth. Here, that same
study projects that the strategy segment will grow 4-6% per year through 2028, with
strategy even stronger, at 8-10%, compared to overall market growth of 4% per year.
Today, 33% of Asmodee's sales stem from the social segment, 37% from strategy, 28%
from family and a modest 2% from children. Thus, in our view, Asmodee has a stellar
mix, tilted towards the fastest-growing segments in the sector.

Partnering up with Asmodee is
a win-win situation

4) The distribution network

Lastly, Asmodee is the only global player that both publishes internal games and
distributes third-party games. This, together with its presence in more than 100
countries across the entire retail channel value chain, enables what we view as
impressive expertise and know-how when it comes to game distribution. This
translates into Asmodee providing partners with valuable insights, enhancing its
reputation and boosting its third-party IP catalogue. Moreover, Asmodee is a desirable
partner because it can help games enter new markets and engage a broader player
base, creating a win-win eéect for Asmodee and collaborators, as we see it.

Opportunities to drive margin expansion
We foresee a margin uplift, but
there is still room to grow to
meet the financial target

6

Because games published by Asmodee are almost twice as profitable as distributed
games, and given that Asmodee intends to accelerate growth initiatives for its
internally-published games, we foresee that the share of games published by Asmodee
will grow from 30% as of the end of 2023/24 to 39% by the end of 2027/28E. Hence, we
expect the gross margin to grow from 41.4% to 46.3% in the same time period, driving a
185bp adjusted EBIT margin uplift in the same period and yielding an adjusted EBIT
CAGR of 10%. This translates into an adjusted EBITDA margin of 18.0% for 2027/28E,
which we note is still slightly below Asmodee's financial targets of an adjusted EBITDA
margin above 18% in the medium term. Hence, we argue that there is still potential for
higher margins, partly from scalability.

A capex-light business model
allows Asmodee to seize
investment opportunities when
they arise

A capex-light business model enables healthy FCF and room to invest

Asmodee operates with a capex-light business model, evidenced by historical and
guided capex levels of 2% of sales. Typically, in order to create a game, both a game
and a graphic designer are required. Generally, though, the two people are able to
work simultaneously on two separate projects over a time period of two to three years,
mitigating capex spending. Furthermore, thanks to Asmodee's global scale, it is able
publish more games per year than the average company, so it tends to recoup its
investment from the first release. Hence, the incremental return on follow-up game
releases comes with high margins, underpinning Asmodee's underlying FCF margins of
around 10%. Such stable FCF generation quickly deleverages the balance sheet,
opening the door to new investment opportunities.

M&A
Solid M&A track record and
more than 20 targets on the
company's radar

M&A could boost EBITDA by
4-18% in our scenario, with
share price upside of 40-70%
compared to our target price

7

Plenty of space for accretive M&A opportunities

The tabletop gaming market remains highly fragmented, with more than half of the
products available in mass-market channels still controlled by small- to medium-sized
players. Thus, Asmodee sees vast opportunities to strengthen its oéering via M&A. Over
the past decade, Asmodee has acquired more than 40 companies from around the
world, including game studios, IPs (publishing rights) and local distributors. In our
view, Asmodee has a solid track record of creating synergies and driving growth via
M&A. Asmodee currently has a pipeline of more than 20 qualified targets, according to
management, either within publishing or distribution.

M&A scenario

We estimate that the leverage ratio will fall from 2.3x as of year-end 2024/25 to 0.7x for
2027/28. Assuming a steady leverage ratio of 2.0x (excluding earnouts) in the coming
years, and that Asmodee on average pays 7x EV/EBITDA, we argue that the company
could add 4-18% to our base-case 2025/26-27/28 EBITDA estimates. In such a scenario,
we see potential for Asmodee to grow adjusted EBIT by 16% per year through
2027/28E. Should this be the case, we see potential for share price levels of SEK
175-204, if we apply a 2027/28E EV/adjusted EBIT multiple of 14-16x. We provide
further details in the Growth pillars chapter.

Valuation
We identify two peer groups:
international game and IP
players and Nordic consumer
goods peers

Current valuation does not reflect the full potential

We benchmark Asmodee against global tabletop game and IP entities and Nordic
consumer goods companies. At present, Asmodee operates with a lower margin profile
than the two key peers we identify, Hasbro and Games Workshop, and than our Nordic
consumer goods peer group. Initially, we expect Asmodee to show slightly slower
earnings growth than both of our peer groups, but we argue that this could change, as
Asmodee could shift its growth profile into higher gear via M&A, and thus at least
deliver similar earnings growth to our broader peer group.
Given its short history as a standalone publicly-listed company, we contend that a
discount to peers is warranted, at least initially. However, we argue that the current
30% discount on 2025E EV/EBIT is excessive. We believe that Asmodee can achieve a
2024/25E-2027/28E adjusted EBIT CAGR of 10%, all organically, which could further
surge towards 16%, if accelerated M&A were to materialise. Such a case could trigger
warranted multiple expansion in our view, leaving additional upside on the table.

We initiate at Buy and a target
price of SEK 118

8

Trading at 2025/26E EV/adjusted EBIT of 12.0x, we see an attractive entry point to buy
into a long-term compelling story. As such, we initiate coverage at Buy, with a
multiples-based target price of SEK 118, implying 2025/26E EV/adjusted EBIT of 14.0x,
a ~20% discount to our broader peer group and a 20% discount to our international key
peers, Hasbro and Games Workshop.

Risks

We see the following key risks for Asmodee. This section is not intended to be a
comprehensive list of all of the potential risks Asmodee could face, but rather to
highlight those we deem most relevant.
First, Asmodee could face reputational risk related to negative public attention around
products distributed by Asmodee or its business partners. Such risk could emanate
from actions taken by Asmodee itself, associated entities or partners on its products,
which could hurt Asmodee and its brand.
Second, Asmodee's operations are subject to several supply chain risks, such as raw
material-, transportation- or logistics-related challenges. All of the foregoing could
impact Asmodee negatively.
Third, Asmodee may be adversely aéected by geopolitical conditions. Asmodee has
sales in more than 100 countries around the world. As such, Asmodee's operations are
impacted by geopolitical events and macroeconomic changes. Asmodee is also reliant
on obtaining and protecting its IP rights in its geographies.
Lastly, given Asmodee's ambitious M&A plans, the potential for unsuccessful
integrations with acquired companies presents a risk.

Asmodee

Company overview
Founded in 1995, Asmodee is one the leading global publishers and distributors of physical and
digital board games and trading card games (TCG). Asmodee operates a portfolio of 23 fullyowned studios, with more than 400 IPs and 950 games, supported by licensing and
distribution partnerships with top-tier IPs and entertainment companies. Some of its most
well-known owned IPs include: Catan, 7 Wonders, Ticket to Ride and Exploding Kittens. In
addition, Asmodee has longstanding licensing and distribution partnerships with franchises,
such as Star Wars, Marvel, Disney, Game of Thrones, Lego, Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering.
Thus, Asmodee has a diversified game portfolio. As of fiscal-year 2023/24, 64% of sales came
from games published by partners and 30% from games published by Asmodee's own studios.
Today, Asmodee has a presence in more than 100 countries, across all retail channels, and
roughly 50% of sales stem from France, Germany and the UK, while ~20% stems from the US.
Its vast distribution network, together with a strong IP portfolio, has been key to growing the
business. In 2023, Asmodee shipped more than 116 million products. Since 2015, Asmodee has
delivered a sales CAGR of 19%, driven by a combination of organic and acquired growth.

Background
In just twenty years, Asmodee
has built up a tremendous IP
portfolio and reached more
than 100 countries

Asmodee was founded in 1995 by Marc Nunes as a publisher of board games in France.
In 1998, it acquired its first IP, Jungle Speed, and has since built up a massive IP
portfolio and longstanding partnerships. For instance, it has been a partner to Magic:
The Gathering and Pokémon since 1995. Asmodee has also selectively acquired IPs,
publishing rights and distributors in order to build up its presence in new geographies,
while also strengthening its catalogue. Today, Asmodee has a diverse portfolio of more
than 400 IPs, consisting of both IPs it owns, such as Ticket to Ride, Catan and 7
Wonders, as well as third-party IPs, such as Pokémon, Magic: The Gathering, Dungeons
& Dragons, Lego, Star Wars, and more.
Asmodee has continuously expanded into new countries across the globe. At the
moment, it has a direct presence in 27 countries, but via selective sub-distribution
agreements, Asmodee's global distribution network extends to more than 100
countries. Asmodee reaches the entire distribution value chain, from local hobby shops
to mass-market and specialist stores, as well as select online channels. As such,
Asmodee has evolved from a local distributor into a global IP-centred entertainment
group.

Asmodee is a leader in top
markets like France, the UK,
Germany and the US

At present, Asmodee is the market leader in France and the UK, and number two in
Germany and number three in the US, according to a market study conducted by
consulting firm Arthur D. Little (2024). We note that these four countries alone
represent around 60% of the total global market, while North America and Western
Europe together account for 75%. To us, this is proof of Asmodee's strong global
position.

ASMODEE: SALES DEVELOPMENT (EURm)

Source: Company data and Nordea estimates

Business model
Primarily involved in physical
games, but Asmodee has
moved into the digital sphere
via its online site, Board Game
Arena, and transmedia
experiences

Asmodee's business model primarily revolves around creating, publishing and
distributing tabletop games. Over the years, Asmodee has also expanded its scope to
digital board games, leveraging its IP portfolio to create comprehensive transmedia
experiences for players. As of 2023/24, 95% of sales went to retailers, such as local
hobby shops, mass-market stores and wholesalers, which then sell the games to
consumers. The remaining 5% of sales are attributable to royalties, direct-to-consumer
sales, video games and subscriptions relating to its digital oéering.

Diversity is the name of the
game, in distribution channels,
IPs, partnership models and
geographies

As of the end of 2024, Asmodee's game portfolio consisted of more than 4,000 product
references published by Asmodee across more than 400 IPs, further complemented by
games published by partners and distributed by Asmodee. This enables a diversified
mix between games published by Asmodee itself and those released via partners.
Asmodee's IPs consist of a mix of owned and licensed IPs. Its internal IPs have either
been developed by any of its 23 studios or are IPs acquired as part of Asmodee's
growth strategy. Some of its most beloved IPs, as we understand it, are Ticket to Ride,
Catan, 7 Wonders, Azul, Hint and Exploding Kittens, among others. The licensed IPs,
however, generally hail from franchise collaborations with third-party IP owners. These
include household names, such as Pokémon, Marvel, Star Wars and Lego.
As noted above, because Asmodee is directly present in 27 countries and also has
myriad sub-distribution agreements, it is able to reach consumers in more than 100
countries. Moreover, it is present across all retail channels, from smaller local hobby
stores to large wholesale players. In our view, it can thus work closely with retailers and
distributors worldwide. Yet, we underscore that Asmodee does not own any production
facilities, fostering a capex-light business model.
Since 2015, the company has delivered what we deem to be an impressive sales CAGR
of 19%. Even if we exclude the COVID-19 boost, sales still grew 19% per year between
2015 and 2019, suggesting that Asmodee has outgrown the market for a long time.

We find the blend of proven
success and taking the chance
on new releases supportive for
long-term growth

As of 2023/24, games published by Asmodee accounted for 30% of sales, while games
published by partners accounted for 60%. The vast IP portfolio includes evergreen IPs,
which have proven enduring; thus, both the existing catalogue and new releases
support growth over time. The vast majority of sales from third parties stems from
trading cards, mostly consisting of Pokémon and Magic: The Gathering. Sales from
games published by Asmodee predominantly pertain to the tabletop segment, but also
include its recent highly successful release of the TCG Star Wars Unlimited, which is
published and developed by its internal studio, Fantasy Flight Games.

Games published by Asmodee
Games published by Asmodee
itself can be twice as profitable
as those run through partners

Asmodee has a diversified portfolio of published games that it owns, in such diverse
categories as social, tabletop and lifestyle games, all aimed at diéerent cohorts. The
portfolio represents a blend of internally-developed games from across its 23 own
studios and strategically acquired IPs, as well as games based on licensed IPs from
well-established franchises. Asmodee's growth here is thus supported by both new
game releases, including new IPs, or follow-up releases for it core franchises. Since
2017, the number of games published by Asmodee studios has grown by 12% per year.
Even more positively, given that Asmodee controls the IPs and/or the development
studios, games published by Asmodee are almost twice as profitable as games
published by partners – this is also thanks to lower royalty costs. All in all, we estimate
that gross margins on games published by Asmodee vary in the range of 55-75%.

Games fit into three categories,
at diéerent price points and
degrees of commitment: social,
tabletop and lifestyle

Social games: These often refer to board games that are small in size, easy to access,
have simple game mechanics and take on average less than 30 minutes to play. Thus,
such games are often played at home with friends or at bars/cafes, and priced at
around EUR 20. Some of these social games from Asmodee include Hint, Exploding
Kittens and Bezzerwizzer.
Tabletop games: These are more of an opportunity to gather the family and/or to
spend time with friends. These games are often referred to as family games or strategy
games and take between 30 minutes and 1.5 hours to complete. They tend to be priced
at around EUR 40-50, reflecting each game's depth and replay value. Some of
Asmodee's more famed names in this sphere are: Ticket to Ride, Catan, 7 Wonders and
Dixit.
Lifestyle games: These are often more complex and require strategic and creative
thinking. Some games also include miniatures, which add dimensions to the games,
oéering a more immersive experience. These games often target fan players with a
deep passion for the games, and see them as a central part of their lifestyles. Naturally,
these games have longer play sessions, which could be up to several days. Hence, the
prices are higher, ranging from EUR 50 to more than EUR 100. Some of Asmodee's
games in this category are: Star Wars Unlimited, Arkham Horror and Twilight Imperium.

Games published by partners
Asmodee is viewed as a
trusted partner by other
publishers and IP owners, in
our assessment

13

Thanks to its strong expertise and know-how in game distribution, Asmodee has, in our
view, become a trusted partner to game publishers and IP owners, which have placed
their confidence in Asmodee to commercialise their games. In this realm, Asmodee
distributes both tabletop and TCGs, but the clear majority consists of sales from trading
cards. Yet, Asmodee also distributes a diversified suite of third-party games, such as
Carcassonne, Bananagrams, Top Ten and Hitster. Asmodee has five-plus years of
established partnerships with key third-party studios.

ASMODEE: SELECTION OF THIRD-PARTY PARTNERSHIPS

Source: Company image

TCGs are a lifestyle leisure activity through which consumers express their identities
and commitment by investing value and time, spending on one or several sets. In
addition, TCG consumers tend to be lifestyle leisure consumers in the sense that they
not only play, but also collect, display and exchange cards outside of their true gaming
time, leading to the build-up of their communities in real life and on social media. TCGs
often create added value for rare cards, leading to a strong secondary market, which in
turn continues to generate positive momentum for new releases in a virtuous circle.
The lifestyle aspect of TCGs
turns them into moneymakers
– they were 64% of total group
sales in 2023/24

The TCG category has historically consisted of a few major ranges, such as the
Pokémon Trading Card Game, Yu-Gi-Oh! or Magic: The Gathering. Here, Asmodee has
longstanding partnerships with all of the major market leaders in TCGs, dating all the
way back to 1995. We believe these solid roots lay the foundation to today's marketleading position. As of 2023/24, TCGs accounted for 46% of total sales through
partners, which explains why TCGs amounted to 64% of total group sales that year.

Market overview
Tabletop games are a steadily growing category in the entertainment industry, oéering a wide
range of experiences, from casual social games to more strategic and challenging games.
Tabletop games can be played in various settings and attract broad audiences. They enjoyed a
surge in popularity and a steep increase in the number of players during the COVID-19 years, as
more people were staying at home. Yet, even after the massive boost during 2020-21 (masssales CAGR of 19%), the market has continued to grow organically, driven by customer loyalty,
a diversified mix of board games and trading card games (TCG), broader distribution, wider
game variety, and the fact that tabletop games remain an inexpensive form of entertainment.
As of 2023, the global tabletop market had a value of EUR 13bn. The market is fragmented, but
set to deliver a mass-market CAGR of 4% through 2028, according to a study commissioned by
Asmodee from the consultancy firm Arthur D. Little ahead of the company's listing, driven by
trends towards in-person socialisation, customer retention and the democratisation of pop
culture.

Tabletop games
Tabletop games account for a
relatively small but vibrant
share of the total
entertainment market

The tabletop games market is a subsegment of the broader toys and games market.
The market competes with other major entertainment sectors, such as books, films and
video games. As of 2023, the global tabletop market was valued at EUR 13bn,
compared to the global toys and games market, at EUR 130bn, and the broader
entertainment and media market, at EUR 3tn, according to the same Arthur D. Little
Study (see charts below). All three of these industries are predominantly fuelled by
economic growth and a rising share of consumer income spent on entertainment.
Tabletop games, including board games and card games, oéer a unique blend of social
interaction, strategic depth and skill-based play, appealing to a wide demographic, in
our view. Board games commonly include a structured set of rules and objectives,
ranging from competitive to cooperative play, and target broad audiences. Card games,
however, ask players to focus on collecting, deck-building and strategic gameplay, with
custom decks to outwit opponents. The sale of both board games and TCGs is mainly
driven by North America and Europe. Both emphasise social interaction, critical
thinking and creativity, oéering diverse experiences for players of all ages.

Geographical split

North America represented 40% of the tabletop market in 2023, followed by Europe, at
35%. This is driven by higher global retail sale prices, higher income levels and cultural
factors that favour social gaming and home-based entertainment. Asia-Pacific
represented 10-15% of the market, while the rest of the world accounted for 5-10%,
according to a recent market study conducted by Arthur D. Little.
The key countries driving the tabletop games market are the US, France, Germany and
the UK, which together account for around 60% of the total tabletop games market.
The US is by far the top geography – in fact, the number of mass-market tabletop
companies in the US jumped from 300 in 2017 to ~470 in 2023. In the same time period,
the US market value grew 6% per year. Currently, Asmodee is the third-strongest player
in the US and holds a market share of 6%, up from 2% in 2020, according to the same
recent market study conducted by Arthur D. Little.

Asmodee

Overall, Asmodee has taken market share in all its key geographies in recent years,
driven by a diversified mix of board and tabletop games, a well-balanced IP portfolio,
which consists of both novelties and successful new releases, selective acquisitions,
and the fact that Asmodee is the only integrated group that distributes both its own
and third-party products.

Competitive landscape
Competitors include Hasbro,
Mattel, Ravensburger and
Games Workshop – Asmodee
also serves as a third-party
distributor to some

Some of Asmodee's major competitors include Hasbro, Mattel, Ravensburger and
Games Workshop. Here, both Hasbro and Mattel also act as partners for Asmodee in
terms of third-party publishing.
Hasbro, the American toy and tabletop games company, is primarily known as the
owner of the franchises Monopoly, Magic: The Gathering, Transformers, and Dungeons
& Dragons. In terms of distribution, Hasbro has strategic partnerships with large retail
channels and third-party distributors, including Asmodee.
Mattel is an American company consisting of 20 brands. It focuses on classic toys, such
as Barbie, Hot Wheels and Nerf, and also oéers family-friendly games, such as Uno and
Pictionary. Similar to Hasbro, Mattel has strategic collaborations with large retail
chains, licensees and third-party distributors, including Asmodee.
Ravensburger is a German company with approximately ten brands, focusing on
puzzles and board games, with such titles as Labyrinth and Castles of Burgundy. The
company recently entered the trading card category via its collaboration with Disney
on Disney Lorcana.
Games Workshop is a British company mainly focused on its miniature tabletop board
game series Warhammer 40,000 and its diéerent editions. It has a distribution network
of more than 500 retail stores across Europe, the US and Asia and also operates with
more than 7,000 independent retailers.

Market size: Past, present and future
Tabletop games are historically
resilient and expected to
remain so – aéordable and
social, they thrive during times
of uncertainty

The tabletop market, including board games and TCGs, has historically and recently
demonstrated strong resilience and a solid growth outlook. During 2006-08, the market
grew by 5% per year on average. Similarly, during the COVID-19 era (2020-21), the
market yielded annual growth of more than 5%. This resilience can be attributed, in our
view, to the inherent strengths of tabletop games, which align closely with people’s
needs during challenging social and economic times. These products oéer an
aéordable source of entertainment, making them accessible even when economic
conditions are less conducive to spending. Moreover, entertainment is often seen as
essential during diêcult times, helping to alleviate the stress of tougher living
conditions. Lastly, tabletop games serve as a means of bringing people together,
fostering social connections that are highly valued during periods of uncertainty.

Asmodee

The market is and has been characterised by stable underlying growth, although
successful high-quality game releases, especially withing the trading card segment,
tend to boost growth during certain times, which can be followed by a shorter period
of weaker growth. Such a pattern occurred in 2016 and 2023. Looking ahead, we expect
tabletop games to sustain their positive momentum, driven by strong trends towards
in-real-life socialisation, customer retention, wider game variety and a broader
geographical reach. Thus, the tabletop market is projected to deliver a CAGR of 4%
through 2028, according to the Arthur D. Little study. Both board games and TCGs are
expected to grow by a steady 4%, but specific growth rates could vary from year to
year, as the trading card market is more dependent on a few major releases.

Market segments: Attractive position for Asmodee
Board games can be divided
into social, strategy, family and
children

In addition, the board games categories within the tabletop market includes: social,
strategy, family and children, each with their own characteristics and trends. As of the
end of 2023, the social games segment accounted for 34% of the global mass market,
strategy accounted for 13%, family represented 28%, and children represented 28%,
while other accounted for 4%, according to the recent market study by Arthur D. Little.
As illustrated below, according to the same Arthur D. Little study, the social and
strategy segments are expected to grow faster than the rest of the subsegments. The
study forecasts that social will grow by 4-6% per year and strategy by 8-10% per year
through 2028. Social games have enjoyed accelerated growth recently, driven by
successful new releases and lower market penetration, benefitting from the presentday already-established large player base. Strategy games have also seen continued
accelerated growth in terms of volumes, driven by the scale-up of the gaming
subculture and enhanced recruitment of new players on the back of the massive
volume gains during COVID-19.

we find Asmodee's exposures
attractive, tilted towards the
fastest-growing segments

Today, 33% of Asmodee's sales stem from the social segment, 37% from strategy, 28%
from family and a modest 2% from children. Thus, in our view, Asmodee has an
attractive mix, tilted towards the fastest-growing segments in the sector. All in all, this
should enable Asmodee to continue to outgrow the market in the coming five years.

Asmodee

Growth pillars
In our view, Asmodee has become a leader in the tabletop gaming industry by combining its
expertise in publishing with a global route-to-market strategy, including both its own products
and products published by partners. Looking ahead, Asmodee intends to further capitalise on a
growing market by strengthening its focus on internal IPs, game creation, retail partnerships
and brand awareness, all of which should support organic growth. In addition, Asmodee plans
to accelerate its M&A agenda, which could further enhance its IPs, publishing rights and
geographic expansion. In total, we model organic growth of 5.7% per year through 2027/28, on
average. For now, we do not pencil in any future contributions from M&A to our base-case
estimates, although we do view these deals as very likely. As such, we include a potential M&A
scenario at the end of this chapter.

Nurturing the old...
Household names will remain
in focus, with their potential for
expansions and related
products

Core IPs will remain a linchpin of growth

Asmodee's catalogue includes high-potential IPs across more than 100 games with
diéerent game styles, attracting a wide range of consumers. As we understand it,
Asmodee aims to continue investing in a selection of games that it deems to have high
potential to become globally-recognised IPs. Here, Asmodee aims to increase its
market penetration via brand awareness through marketing and product line
management, such as expansions, licensed products and complementary products.
This, together with improve retail channel penetration, making products available
across all retail channels, should expand the potential target audience. Moreover,
Asmodee plans to leverage its online gaming platform, Board Game Arena, which
boasts more than ten million users, as a platform to strengthen brand awareness.

Flagship franchises have a long
sales tail, thanks to updates
and new editions

As illustrated in the chart below, there is still room for growth for Asmodee's flagship
franchises, as they tend to have a long sales tail. For reference, one of its long-time
brands, Ticket to Ride, released back in 2004, has sold 19 million units and has
garnered a community of more than 80 million players. In our view, such success is
underpinned by Asmodee's approach of continuously releasing updates to engage the
player base. For instance, Ticket to Ride has gone through two base games, nine map
expansions, and junior (children's) and city versions, as well as deluxe editions, totalling
more than 26 references in its portfolio. Furthermore, the game is still under
development to sustain player engagement.

...but in with the new
Even so, Asmodee is always on
the lookout for innovation,
both in-house and via
partnerships

Potential for novel IPs to become core

Despite its commitment to legacy games, Asmodee is also on the hunt for new
products. We understand that the company aims to expand its portfolio through a
combination of internal innovation and strategic collaborations to add new games and
solidify its position as a market leader. Each of its 23 in-house studios addresses
specific player types. Given Asmodee's distribution network, studios can react to local
trends and rapidly evolve in response to emerging phenomena to create the sorts of
games in demand by end customers. Moreover, Asmodee both expands existing IPs
and enters into new collaborations based on third-party IPs.

Transmedia experiences
Transmedia is a way to bring
legacy games into the current
era and maintain player
engagement

Asmodee also aims to raise brand awareness and increase sales by expanding its IPs
into new channels of entertainment, including transmedia storytelling, digital
adoptions and other media content. The goal is to oéer new ways for players to engage
with its preferred brands. Below, we show an example of how the legacy game Ticket
to Ride has evolved over the past two decades to stay relevant, culminating in its
launch on digital platforms in 2023.

Becoming a next-level retail partner
Its proven route-to-market
strategy makes Asmodee an
ideal partner, in our view

Asmodee plans to continue to build a compelling product portfolio and customer
oéering, and to do so, is committed to further investing in infrastructure, targeted retail
support and supplier partnerships by leveraging its industry expertise to develop its
role as a partner across the entire retail channel value chain.
Through further product development and investments across its portfolio, we believe
that Asmodee is well placed to expand its reach by entering new markets and
channels. In addition, with its go-to-market strategy, Asmodee can expand its
catalogue for existing partners. This could be especially salient in the US, where
Asmodee's current operations predominantly consist of its internal published games. In
recent years, Asmodee has gradually expanded its catalogue to games distributed by
partners, which Asmodee intends to accelerate going forward. We note that Asmodee
is the only global group that combines both internal publishing and third-party
distribution from partners across the entire retail channel. As such, Asmodee can
expand its catalogue towards new retailers and with existing partners.

ASMODEE: DISTRIBUTION OFFERING

Source: Company image

In a fragmented market,
Asmodee is a successful
consolidator – for both
publishing and distribution

M&A engine

The tabletop gaming market remains highly fragmented, with more than half of the
products available in mass-market channels still controlled by small- to medium-sized
players. The fragmentation is even more pronounced in the distribution segment. Thus,
Asmodee sees vast opportunities to strengthen its oéering via M&A. Over the past
decade, Asmodee has acquired more than 40 companies from around the world,
including game studios, IPs (publishing rights) and local distributors. In our view,
Asmodee has a solid track record of creating synergies and driving growth via M&A.
Typically, as we understand it, the rationale behind its acquisition choices is based on
accretive margin expansion by acquiring IP rights, scaling up proven assets or gaining
access to creative capacity.

Asmodee evaluates potential targets that could enhance its publishing and/or
distribution capabilities on an ongoing basis to further strengthen its position as an
industry consolidator. Asmodee primarily focuses on game studios and IPs, which
enable Asmodee to expand its product oéering via games published by acquired
studios. It also aéords Asmodee the chance to foster creation potential for new IPs and
accelerate IP monetisation. In addition, we understand that Asmodee evaluates
acquisition opportunities for local distributors in order to cement its position in existing
markets or to enter new geographies.
In our assessment, Asmodee could follow several paths. For example, it could increase
the number of internal IPs in the social segment, expanding its presence in some of its
strongest-growing categories. Alternatively, it could acquire some of its best-selling
distributed games, thereby improving margins, as no royalties would need to be paid.
Lastly, Asmodee could also expand its reach in the lifestyle segment to engage more
closely with its top recurring buyers. We argue all of these three possibilities are
equally likely and should be seen as low-risk acquisitions as Asmodee often has
already established partnership with its acquisition target.

6 March 2025

Asmodee

Asmodee currently has a pipeline of more than 20 qualified targets, according to
management, either within publishing or distribution. Considering its capex-light
business model and Embracer's recent capital injection of EUR 400m, the leverage
ratio should come down rather quickly. We estimate that the leverage ratio will fall
from 2.3x as of year-end 2024/25E to 0.7x for 2027/28E. As such, we envision plenty of
opportunities for Asmodee to accelerate its M&A agenda going forward.

Accelerated M&A scenario
Assuming a steady leverage ratio of 2.0x in the coming years, and that Asmodee on
average pays 7x EV/EBITDA, we argue the company could add 4-18% to our base-case
2025/26-27/28 EBITDA estimates.

Asmodee

Financial outlook
Asmodee has a track record of outgrowing the market. Given its attractive exposure to the
fastest-growing subsegments – social and strategy, its vast IP portfolio of both internallypublished and third-party games, and presence across the entire retail value chain, we argue
that Asmodee is well positioned to continue to do so. We foresee net sales growth of 5.7% per
year through 2027/28. We estimate that a stronger top line, a higher share of sales from its
internally-published games and scale eéects will fuel adjusted EBIT growth of 10% per year in
the same time period. However, because Asmodee will likely need to take on some higher costs
to support organic growth, we foresee that earnings growth will not start to accelerate until H2
2025/26. In total, we expect the adjusted EBIT margin to expand from 14.2% for 2024/25 to
15.9% for 2027/28. Yet, this would still come up short of the financial target of an adjusted
EBITDA margin of above 18%. We do not include any future M&A in our base-case estimates,
but do view these deals as highly likely (see our M&A scenario in the Growth pillars chapter).
Thanks to the company's capex-light business model, we expect cash flow to follow, enabling
future investment opportunities for M&A or for potential dividends.

Asmodee

Valuation and financial benchmarking
Considering Asmodee's market exposure, its most relevant peers are international. However,
given its tilt towards end consumers, we also benchmark Asmodee against other Nordic
consumer goods companies. Asmodee operates with a lower margin profile than its key peers
Hasbro and Games Workshop and than our Nordic consumer goods peer group. We also
expect Asmodee to show slightly slower earnings growth than our broader peer group.
However, we note that this growth will likely all be organic, and that Asmodee can shift its
growth profile into higher gear via M&A, and deliver at least similar earnings growth versus
peers. Given its short history as a standalone publicly-listed company, we contend that a
discount to peers is warranted, at least initially. However, we argue that the current 30%
discount on 2025E EV/EBIT is excessive. We believe that Asmodee can achieve a
2024/25E-2027/28E adjusted EBIT CAGR of 10%, all organically, which could further accelerate
towards 16%, if accelerated M&A were to materialise. Trading at 2025/26E EV/adjusted EBIT of
~12x, we see an attractive entry point to buy into a long-term compelling story. Our target price
of SEK 118 implies 2025/26E EV/adjusted EBIT of 14x, a ~20% discount to our broader peer
group and a 20% discount to our international key peers, Hasbro and Games Workshop.

Recommendation structure and fair value sensitivity

Equity risk rating

(absolute ratings)

Nordea risk rating: Asmodee
3
As a measure of the company's operational risk we, apply a risk rating scale of 1-5
where 1 is the lowest risk and 5 is the highest. The risk rating is calculated using a
weighted average of earnings/cash flow predictability, earnings quality and backwardlooking asset beta. For the most illiquid stocks, the risk rating is also adjusted for
liquidity risk. The risk rating is then converted to asset beta and used to calculate the
cost of capital. It is thus implicitly included in our fair value calculations.

Buy:

Positive share price potential versus our fair value
and we see a compelling investment case to buy the share.

Sell:

Negative share price potential versus our fair value
and we see a compelling investment case to sell the share.

Hold:

Share in line with our fair value and/or no compelling
investment case.
We calculate our fair values by weighting DCF, DDM, SOTP, asset-based and other
standard valuation methods. When applicable, we set a 12-month target price by
applying an appropriate premium/discount and/or other relevant adjustment to our
fair value to reflect the share price potential we see within the coming 12 months. Our
fair values are sensitive to changes in valuation assumptions, of which growth,
margins, tax rates, working capital ratios, investment-to-sales ratios and cost of
capital are typically the most sensitive.
It should be noted that our fair values would change by a disproportionate factor if
changes are made to any or all valuation assumptions, owing to the non-linear nature
of the standard valuation models applied (mentioned above). As a consequence of
the standard valuation models we apply, changes of 1-2 percentage points in any
single valuation assumption can change the derived fair value by as much as 30% or
more. Dividend payouts are included in the target price. All research is produced on
an ad hoc basis and will be updated when the circumstances require it.
