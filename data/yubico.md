The world has changed in many ways in recent years. The cloud-computing market grew
fivefold from 2010–21, but most IT work is still carried out on-premises, meaning that these
environments are clearly hybrid. As a result, the number of attack surfaces has increased
massively over the past decade and the number of cyber-attacks has increased exponentially
in recent years. We find that security spending is one of the most prioritised investments in
enterprises, regardless of where we are in the economic cycle. As such, the cybersecurity
market has expanded significantly in value, and we believe it will grow over the foreseeable
future. Several security platforms have emerged to take significant market share in this
industry. Owing to its security standard, its interoperability and it being system agnostic,
Yubico is integrated and used in all these platforms. Companies such as Google, Microsoft,
Meta, Salesforce, Amazon and even Okta, which manages an identity access management
(IAM) platform, use YubiKeys as their authentication service daily.
This report serves as a primer on the cybersecurity market and as an initiation of coverage
of Yubico, which we rate BUY with a SEK130 target price. Yubico has enjoyed a 49% CAGR
in revenue between 2015 and 2022, but we think that plenty of growth remains. The
company is profitable and well capitalised, but early in its margin journey. The penetration
levels of its services are low, even with its existing customers, making revenue dependent
on client retention, new contracts, and Yubico’s large community of users. We argue that
Yubico is a leader in its niche, and that there are alternatives to its products but no real
competition. As such, we believe this is a unique asset that has survived and thrived through
the evolution and rapid change of the cybersecurity market. As Yubico is exposed to
markets with secular growth trends and several expansion opportunities, we think that this
will prove to be a strong long-term investment case.

Yubico

Investment case
Yubico has survived and thrived through the evolution of cybersecurity

The cybersecurity market has undergone rapid growth and rapid change. Attack surfaces are
expanding, with cloud processes being carried out across multiple networks, often in combination
with on-premises applications. This is particularly so in the wake of the Covid-19 pandemic,
which saw a dramatic rise in work-from-home (WFH) hybrid working environments. There are
many reasons why hacking and cyber warfare have increased, among them the significant
amounts of money involved. This has led to a rapid change in the cybersecurity market: vendors
that once dominated the market, such as McAfee, Norton and Kaspersky, today have a negligible
presence in the enterprise world. Yubico has thrived in this environment and increased its
relevance. For its purposes, we argue that Yubico is a leading vendor.

The Yubico offer

Yubico’s core offering centres on its multi-factor authentication (MFA) hardware device
YubiKey, which requires the user to combine a security key with either a PIN or a type of
biometric security component, such as a fingerprint. In order to login to a service, the user i)
plugs the YubiKey into a device, ii) presses the button to activate it, and iii) awaits the YubiKey
to generate a unique login code that the service uses for identity confirmation. The physical aspect
of the hardware device adds another level of complexity to the two-factor authentication (2FA)
solution, so separating the YubiKey from other 2FA solutions. To date, the YubiKey has proven
impenetrable. Companies like Google, Microsoft, Meta, Salesforce, Amazon and even Okta,
which manages an IAM platform, use YubiKey as a security service daily.

Alternatives, but no real competition

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

There are alternatives to Yubico, such as Google’s authenticator, Authy, Duo and Ping, but our
understanding is that these have not been able to replace Yubico when security requirements are
at their highest. These alternatives compete with each other, but their platforms become better
when they resell Yubico, as it offers additional security layers to digital-only authentication –
phishing resistance, malware resistance – in addition to its strong cryptography and multiprotocol support. We therefore prefer to see Yubico an enhancement to these services. There are
other physical alternatives, such as keycards, which offer solid security, but they can only be
utilised for one specific use-case, are challenging to scale, and cannot integrate to more services.
They are essentially a physical counterpart to the digital authenticators – key alternatives that offer
only that single open/do-not-open function. They lack the security that Yubico offers, the
breadth of services that Yubico integrates with, the large user-based community behind and its
customisation. We think that this is a unique asset, with no real competition.

Open architecture, able to integrate everywhere

We believe that Yubico’s approach to openness is one of the key factors in its success. There are
closed ecosystem alternatives in the market that have not taken off, where a vendor offers a key,
but requires a buyer to get their software backend and frontend and no customisability. Yubico
has taken a different approach: the keys can integrate with basically any application and platform.
A customer can select Thales, Okta or Microsoft software, but Yubico’s keys. We believe that
this has increased the awareness and the usage of Yubico and it lowers the threshold for a
potential customer acquisition. With the increased usage and awareness, a community has been
created around their products, which is itself a moat. This openness and the possibility to use the
key for every relevant application is highly supportive for the long-term growth.

Proven land and expand notion, driving rapid growth

The existing customer base has driven a significant portion of the growth over the last three years.
The openness, described above, is one of the key factors in the go-to-market and the sales notion.
According to the company, a customer typically starts small, where an IT or security specialist
within a larger organisation discovers YubiKey and does due diligence on the product. They
purchase it for their department, and given its openness, it functions with existing processes.
From there, happy users help grow the penetration within an organisation. Yubico estimates that
6

18 September 2023

c

Yubico

among its largest group customers, it has penetrated less than 10% of the potential user
population, leaving significant room for growth. Moreover, with an average annual repurchase
rate of 132% by the 25 largest customers between 2017 and 2022, Yubico’s existing customers
thus drive a large portion of the growth.

Attractive, but also improving, financial profile

Yubico has consistently sustained an attractive gross margin profile. Since 2016, the company has
reported an average gross margin of above 81%, and it has expanded it in recent years. The
company is already profitable, recording an EBIT margin of 14% in 2022. The sales CAGR has
been 49% between 2016 and 2022, which we think is impressive. We model a sales CAGR of
21% over 2022–25e, expecting a strong pace of growth, with an EBIT CAGR of 35% and
modelling the EBIT margin expanding to 20%. We think this constitutes a strong financial
platform.

Security spending remains key priority

In the aftermath of the pandemic and with the rise of the data cloud, cybersecurity spending has
been high. Our cybersecurity industry sales index shows that the average quarterly Y/Y growth
between 2017–20 was ~19% and accelerated to over 25% from 2020 to 2022. This should also
be seen in the light of the market structure changing, with companies such as Crowdstrike and
Zscaler gaining significant ground, while legacy vendors such as Norton are losing significant
share. We think that spending will remain high in the near term. Company guidance from leading
security vendors remains clearly upbeat, and signals +20% growth for the coming twelve months,
while enterprise CIO surveys show that cybersecurity spending will increase going forward,
despite the macro backdrop, in contrast to many other software categories, where spending is
rather looking set to moderate.

Rising threat environment to drive long-term demand

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

The world has changed in many ways in the past years. Data from market research firm IoT
Analytics shows that the cloud computing market reached USD157bn in value in 2021, from
below USD25bn in 2010, while most of the workload is still on-premises, meaning that IT
environments are clearly hybrid. Adding to this, workers used to sit in offices, but many
enterprises have adopted remote policies. As a result, we find that the attack surfaces for hackers
have increased massively over the past decade, but especially in recent years. The economics of
hacking have also improved in recent years, according to Crowdstrike, something evident to us
in the number of hacking attempts on individuals and enterprises alike; unique malware strains
exceed 130m per year, from below 10m in 2010, according to McKinsey.

Yubico could be a buyout candidate

Consolidation is so common in the industry that all the market players that we have listed in this
report have acquired other companies. Acquisitions are done to complement an existing offering,
or to enter a vertical of the market where one has not been present before. Given that Yubico
fits so well with various cybersecurity platforms and offerings, and adds another security layer to
them, we think that Yubico could be seen as a takeover target as well.

Key investment concerns

Penetration model makes long-term growth riskier

Generally, we think that business models that have recurring or repetitive revenue are better than
models that do not. There are industrial companies that the market considers as having attractive
business models as well, which rely significantly on aftermarket revenue, such as from servicing
the installed base (e.g. Atlas Copco). We argue that Yubico has an element of a penetration model,
and that this makes growth a bit riskier. For every given year, Yubico needs to add many more
net new YubiKeys to keep growing its revenue base. A company like Fortnox, which consists
almost entirely of SaaS revenue, does not in theory have to add a new customer or upsell an
existing customer to have the same revenue next year as the revenue for this year, whereas the
revenue of a business that relies entirely on new sales is ‘reset’ every year. While we think the
company has ample growth opportunities, the trajectory is riskier than for a SaaS company,
18 September 2023

c

Yubico

especially when looking over the very long term. Yubico does not have the aftermarket element,
nor does it have the SaaS tick either. However, there is a replacement cycle for YubiKeys, which
we estimate to be between four to five years, and there is a staff churn/lost keys trait: when there
is staff churn, a new recruit requires a new key, and keys are occasionally lost. This, together with
Yubico’s early successes in selling subscriptions rather than the perpetual sales, creates a solid
base revenue base for its business.

After subscription expansion, further expansion looks limited

As we have already outlined in this section and throughout the report, we appreciate that Yubico
has added a subscription service in addition to its perpetual keys. We expect a constant stream of
key launches in the coming year, with updated security standards and functionalities. But given
how crowded and competitive the cybersecurity market is, we think that expansion into new
verticals is limited. We believe it is likely that Yubico will be resold by more parties, and we think
it is likely that they will be included in various tech platforms’ offerings, which in a way is a sales
channel expansion. We think it could be possible for Yubico to enter the market for IAM more
broadly, and not just offer the authentication, but we think further expansion is limited.

Pricing structure is a weakness

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

We believe that Yubico’s pricing structure could have been optimised over its life. Simply put, we
think that the price is too low considering the level of security it adds, but we also think it is
complicated to change the current pricing structure. The ASP attributable to Yubico is below
EUR30 per key. The slimmest and cheapest package that Crowdstrike offers costs USD60 per
year and endpoint (the minimum sale is for five endpoints, so USD300) – this is per endpoint
and each employee is likely to have more than one endpoint. In addition, the price for
Crowdstrike is annual and recurring, compared to the perpetual nature of the YubiKey. Finally,
this is the very slimmest version of Crowdstrike, compared to the YubiKey which is packed with
security protocols and can be used to secure many different accounts. The ‘medium’ Crowdstrike
offering, which we think is the one that most customers opt for, is about double the price of the
slim version. We think that Yubico could raise its price gradually over time, but we think an
adjustment would take time, if it ever occurs. While penetration levels are low, we think that the
price is so established that new and prospective customers would baulk at steep increases. We
also believe that resellers into the consumer market have inventories, which also prolongs a
potential price change. Given that they have had this kind of pricing structure from inception,
we do not think it is possible to shift to a more value-based pricing model. We think that this has
hampered both the growth and the margins of the business.

The technology is proven, but there could still be rapid change

Yubico has survived and even thrived as the cybersecurity market has undergone rapid change.
The security market has taken two new directions in the past years: zero trust and passkeys, both
of which are beneficial for Yubico, we think. Yubico has a strong position and reputation today,
but this does not mean they will last forever. We have seen how some cybersecurity companies,
which at their peaks were leaders, but are now non-existent. We have seen how certain ways to
prevent attacks were the consensus, but which are now obsolete. We think it is important to
monitor the progress in the security landscape. Security is an ongoing process, not just one sale
or one installation. If there would be changes to the authentication market, Yubico is at risk,
given it has basically only one product.

Yubico

Company background
Yubico was founded with the mission to make secure logins easy and available for
everyone. Since its foundation in 2007, the company has established itself as a leader for
secure authentication services with the launch of the YubiKey product, a hardware-based
cybersecurity device for authentication that has been sold in more than 22m units with
zero identified successful hacking attempts according to the company. Yubico has a
strong growth track record with a sales CAGR of 50% during 2016–22, and closed 2022
with net sales of SEK1,561m and an operating profit of SEK215m. The company has a
global footprint and is used by thousands of organisations in more than 160 countries.
Yubico employs more than 400 people and is headquartered in Palo Alto, CA.
Yubico was founded in 2007 in Sweden by Stina Ehrensvärd (CEO until 2023 – now on the
board) and Jakob Ehrensvärd (CIO) with the ambition to develop a solution that would enable
easy, secure and accessible solutions for logins. The idea resulted in the development of physical
security keys, so called YubiKeys, that are hardware authentication devices that provide access to
computers and services. Instead of focusing on so called smart cards, which was one of the most
popular alternatives, Yubico wanted to develop a solution that was easy, robust, and compatible
with all computers, which led the company to the USB-based YubiKey solution.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

The YubiKeys resemble a traditional USB hard drive but are used as a way of authenticating the
user. In short, it makes two-factor authentication (2FA) easy and secure: a user enters hers/his
username and password, then inserts or presses the YubiKey to authenticate the login. Apart
from the physical keys Yubico has developed software solutions which facilitate the use of
YubiKeys and has free Software Development Toolkits (SDKs) that allow developers to integrate
Yubico’s hardware security into their apps and services.
The company’s breakthrough occurred around the launch of the original YubiKey at the cyber
security conference RSA in 2008, in relation to which the company was featured on the “Security
Now” podcast. This generated positive press coverage and brought the first customers, who
could go on to represent a base of an open-source community. To meet the increasing interest in
its products, Yubico set up a webstore allowing individuals to purchase and test the company’s
new product. The move proved successful, as employees of larger tech companies, including the
likes of Google, started to place orders, which eventually provided Yubico with an entry into
some of the world’s largest businesses.

In 2011, the team moved to Silicon Valley to be closer to the leading internet companies, which
proved to be the right decision. The company has been able to leverage these relationships to
perfect its offering, where especially Google has been a very important customer and partner that
has helped Yubico in developing new security standards.
Today, Yubico has close to 400 employees in more than 14 countries, and its products are used
globally by more than 15m users in thousands of businesses. Its customers include both small
and large enterprises throughout a broad range of industries, as well as private individuals. More

On 19 April 2023, Yubico announced that it had merged with the Special Purpose Acquisition
Company (SPAC) ACQ Bure, where ACQ will change its name to Yubico AB. The transaction,
which is subject to approval by general meetings, is expected to be completed during Q3(23). The
merger transaction valued Yubico shares at USD800m (SEK8.3bn).

The YubiKeys

Yubico’s core product offering consists of an array of ‘YubiKeys’ – physical hardware that look
like traditional USB hard drives but are actually used as a method of user authentication. There
is a range of sizes and connection types to choose from (USB-A, USB-C, Lightning and NFC),
depending on the user’s needs and preferences.
Traditional passwords are not impossible to hack. On the contrary, they are quite easy to hack if
a person with the right skill set decides to. Instead of only using a username and password to
login, the YubiKey offers another layer of security as the users will need it to authenticate their
identity upon login – not just the correct username and password, but the right person using
them. The YubiKey provides a range of authentication choices, including strong two-factor
authentication, multi-factor authentication and password-less authentication, which we cover in
more detail later.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

A YubiKey has multiple functions to secure login to email, online services, apps, computers and
even physical spaces. It requires no software installation or battery; all a user has to do is register
the YubiKey through the account of each specific software or application, and the key is good to
go. Once the YubiKey is registered, the user simply inserts it into a USB port, or the chosen
connection type, during the login process and physically taps the key to verify the user is present
and not a remote hacker trying to access it. On any NFC supported device, such as a mobile
phone, users of the YubiKey simply tap the key to the device to authenticate themselves.
It may sound simple, but it is a bit more complicated under the hood. When a key is registered
to a software or service, a pair of cryptographic keys is created – one private and one public. The
public key is stored on the server of said software, and the private one is stored on the device. If
someone tries to transfer login information with the wrong private key, the service will not grant
access to the account. Below is an illustration of how the one-time passcode works with the
YubiKey, another layer of security and slightly more complicated.

The YubiKeys also supports multi-factor authentication, i.e., a combination of hardware
authentication with a PIN which is received through Yubico software installed on either mobile
or computer, and it can also replace passwords so users can access accounts by only authenticating
with the key, i.e., single-factor authentication. Those that do not wish to always keep the hardware
with them to authenticate every login can choose for devices to be remembered as ‘authenticated’
for around a month at a time.
How the YubiKey works

Source: Yubico

For someone with limited technical knowledge it might seem a hassle to set up the YubiKey,
especially as the settings for every software application look different. To avoid limiting the user
base and to ease the use of its products, Yubico has created a catalogue of compatible software
and services, as well as information on which YubiKeys are compatible with each software
application and how to set up the keys before first use.

The YubiKeys are compatible with close to 1,000 enterprise, developer and consumer
applications and software, according to the company, which can be found in the catalogue on the
website. The YubiKeys support a wide range of protocols, such as WebAuthn/FIDO2 U2F, onetime password (OTP), OpenPGP 3 and smart card authentication. Essentially it means that the
keys support authentication and safety procedures for a wide range of applications and software,
both legacy and modern solutions. The list of Yubico-compatible software and services includes
Facebook, Twitter, Office365, Salesforce and Windows.

The YubiKeys are small, sleek and easy to carry around, and they can secure several of the user’s
accounts. One of the bigger drawbacks of the YubiKeys is the risk of losing them, in our view,
but that being one of the biggest risks is a testament to the security it offers. When people leave
their house, they often tend to bring their keys, wallet and phone with them. Related to losses,
when Yubico conducted a study in 2022, only 26% of people had lost their house keys in the
preceding years, and most of the people asked had never lost either house keys or phone. We
think this points to most people being careful and looking after both their keys and phone, but
also that the criticism that the YubiKey is easy to misplace seems to be as true for phones and
thus is a risk for mobile application MFA as well.

The safest thing to do would be to buy at least 1–2 spare keys which are also set up to the same
accounts as the primary key, which assures the user’s access to their account even if the primary
key is lost. The backup keys could then be stored somewhere safe and easy to remember. Some
services provide the user with one-time codes upon registration, which are to be stored separately
and used in case the key is lost. The last step would be to proceed with a rigorous (depending on
the service) recovery procedure and in most cases sending in identity verification to retrieve access
to the account.

Different series for different needs

There are several series of YubiKeys, catering to everything from ‘protect my social media’-users
to more advanced enterprise users that need keys to support more complex protocols. For those
that are unsure of which YubiKey is right for them, there is even a quiz on Yubico’s website. We
will cover the different types of YubiKeys briefly, demonstrating the company’s broad customer
scope.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

The YubiKey 5 series is promoted as “The world’s #1 multi-protocol security key” on Yubico’s
website, and we believe it is one of the best all-round keys with a wide range of supported
protocols and authentication choices (U2F, FIDO2, WebAuthn, OpenPGP and more). They
come in several sizes and in terms of price the series is positioned in the mid-segment of Yubico’s
products, starting at EUR50 per key.
The YubiKey FIPS and YubiKey Bio series are slightly more expensive, starting at EUR80 and
EUR90 respectively, and offer slightly more than the 5 series. The FIPS series is compatible with
more advanced protocols and is FIPS 140-2 validated, which is a US government computer
security standard. It enables government agencies and regulated industries to meet the highest
authenticator assurance level (level 3 requirements from NIST SP800-63B guidance), according
to Yubico. The main difference between the Yubico Bio series and the others is the key verifies
the user via biometric fingerprint reading instead of only tapping the key.
The YubiKey Security Key is Yubico’s cheapest key, starting at EUR25, and is a slightly more
‘basic’ key compared to the previously mentioned series. It still does the job with strong multifactor authentication, but it does not support as many protocols as e.g., the 5 series. Still, it
supports FIDO2, WebAuthn and FIDO U2F, and allows for access across desktops and mobiles
through tap-and-authenticate capabilities.
The YubiKey 5 CSPN series is the first CSPN-certified multi-protocol authenticator line-up,
according to Yubico, meaning it meets stringent security and authentication standard per
guidance issued by the French Network and Information Security Agency (ANSSI).
Hardware Security Modules (HSM) are typically used to protect server environments and the
cryptographic keys stored on those servers, which tend to be expensive and difficult to set up, as
we understand it. The YubiHSM 2 enables organisations of any size to enhance cryptographic
key security and reduce risk, it is somewhat of an outlier in the Yubico product offering and the
starting price is around EUR650.

Software, services and subscriptions

Apart from its core offering of YubiKeys, Yubico offers complementary software which can
increase the value of the YubiKeys for the customers, and it even has a YubiKey subscription
offering to make the onboarding and ongoing service easier.
Yubico Authenticator is authenticator software enabling multi-factor authentication, available
for both desktop and mobile use. It works much like many other authenticator applications,
generating a one-time code used to verify a user’s identity when logging into an account.
However, the differentiating factor is that “authentication identifiers” are stored in the YubiKey
rather than in the app itself, which means it is necessary to have the YubiKey present to receive
the one-time code from the authenticator.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Yubico offers software that allows users to secure their Windows login with YubiKeys. By
installing Yubico Login for Windows, users can make the login to their computers work like
any other account. If the user account is managed by Azure Active Directory (ADD), it is even
possible to use this Yubico solution without the software.
Developers that want to integrate YubiKey with their software can easily do so by using the
Yubico software development toolkits (SDKs). Yubico has a wide range of mobile SDKs, such
as for iOS and Android, and desktop SDKs which allow developers to add hardware based strong
authentication to, for example, new mobile apps.
YubiKeys-as-a-service, or YubiEnterprise Subscription (YES) as it also is called, is a
subscription option primarily aimed at enterprises with more than a couple of hundred users. As
businesses are changing (e.g., more remote work), employees come and go, and users are working
across several platforms (desktop, mobile, shared workstations etc.) it is easier to choose a
YubiEnterprise Subscription rather than managing everything in-house. With the subscription,
organisations can easily upgrade to the latest YubiKeys as they become available, they get
discounts for purchasing backup keys, and access to priority support, among other things.
Through the web user interface, the company can easily get an overview of the subscription and
services in use and additional keys can easily be added.

Not only does the enterprise solution simplify everything from purchasing new keys to having
priority support, it is also expected to be more affordaable during a three-year period with som
expected replacement, according to Yubico. In a typical case with 1,000 users, two keys per user
and a 20% replacement rate (which is the typical replacement rate for YubiKeys), the subscription
setup would yield cost savings of ~USD57,000 over a three-year period and would include more
keys, according to Yubico. The biggest variable factor is the replacement rate, we believe, and
even though we argue people tend to be careful with their keys (house keys, car keys and
YubiKeys all alike), we believe the replacement rate is also driven by e.g., computer upgrades,
emloyee turnover and the need for newer YubiKey series supporting additional protocols.

Multi-factor authentication – and more

Two-factor authentication, multi-factor authentication, strong two-factor authentication and
strong multi-factor authentication are all terms you encounter when reading about Yubico’s
products, and are important to understand when assessing the potential value of the YubiKeys.
Two-factor authentication is a type of multi-factor authentication, something we believe many
have used without thinking about it. With two-factor authentication a user is required to present
two pieces of evidence, or factors, to an authentication mechanism, such as username + password
and type in a one-time password sent to a pre-verified phone number. Multi-factor authentication
includes two or more factors in the categories of:
• Something the user knows (PIN, password, or security question)
• Something the user has (trusted device, hardware key, smart card, OTP etc.)

Source: Carnegie Research, Yubico

The definition of ‘strong authentication’ seems to vary a bit depending on where you look. We
use the definitions presented on Yubico’s website in this report.
According to Yubico, strong authentication must fulfil two criteria: 1) it does not rely solely on
shared secrets/symmetric keys at any point (including passwords, codes and recovery questions)
and 2) it should robustly repel credential phishing and impersonation. This means that one-time
passwords received via email or SMS do not count as strong authentication, neither do software
authentication apps, out-of-band authentication and sometimes not even biometrics, according
to Yubico. Smart card authentication (such as credit cards in the EU) and hardware authentication
keys (such as the YubiKeys) together with a knowledge-based token such as a PIN, offer strong
authentication, according to Yubico.

Risk of breaches and potential security issues

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

One of the biggest benefits of using YubiKeys instead of ‘traditional’ username + password
combinations is the increased security of multi-factor authentication. Multi-factor authentication
can be achieved by mobile applications instead of physical keys, but these methods are more
susceptible to phishing breaches, phone hacking or illegal interception of the data if a PIN is sent
by SMS for example.
The YubiKeys are not connected to the internet and are used only during the authentication stage
of a login attempt. The YubiKeys also have an additional layer of security, as a user must either
physically tap the key or even scan his or her fingerprint, to show that it is a ‘true’ authentication
and not illicit software on the computer trying the access the key. It is one thing to illegally gain
access to digital information, but it is quite another thing to gain access to a physical item. There
have been zero YubiKey account takeovers since inception on a total sold base of more than 22m
YubiKeys, according to the company.
Past YubiKey issues
Apart from a key being lost or stolen, from the user’s perspective there is another moment of
risk that might pass unnoticed: the production. An error in the production of the keys could have
a severe negative impact on the users, as well as substantially damage the Yubico brand. In 2019
Yubico recalled a line of security keys due to a firmware flaw, as the flaw reduced the randomness
of the cryptographic keys it generates, according to Yubico. All affected customers received a
replacement key and Yubico stated that it was not aware of any security breaches due to this issue,
but flaw reduced the security of the keys. A similar problem also was identified in 2017, with an
older model of YubiKeys, after that Yubico switched to a different key generation function.
Lessons from the RSA breach in 2011
RSA is one of the global leaders and pioneers within computer and network encryption. The
company is named after its three co-founders (Ron Rivest, Adi Shamir and Leonard Adleman)
which also have the RSA public key cryptography algorithm named after them. The company
offers various products within the IT security space, more specifically in the authentication
vertical, and perhaps its most famous product is the physical one-time password generator called
SecurID.
18

18 September 2023

c

Yubico

In 2011 RSA’s most precious core was breached and the SecurIDs used by millions of users,
ranging from government and military agencies to banks and corporations around the world,
were no longer safe. Many key RSA executives involved in the breach were bound by 10-year
nondisclosure agreements, according to Wired. Wired wrote a long story on the full RSA breach
(20 May 2021) and interviewed several people with insights into the matter, which we use as the
basis for the summary below.
It all started when an unknowing employee received an email with the subject line ‘2011
Recruitment plan’ with an attached excel file. Once the file was opened, the hackers were in. The
goal of the hackers seemed to be a server with what is called ‘seeds’, an integral part of the
SecurID’s secret tokens. With the seeds, hackers could potentially clone the identity tokens and
break the two-factor authentication that was RSA’s main product. After a long cat and mouse
race the hackers managed to retrieve the valuable seeds from RSA’s servers. A long recovery path
was to follow, where employees had to work long hours to assist all customers and eventually
review all SecurIDs and replace the keys over time.
A breach, especially of this magnitude, is particularly hurtful to a company that has built its brand
around security, we believe. There is a similar risk for Yubico’s OTP protocol, which we think is
worth highlighting, but we think such a breach would do more damage to the brand than to the
actual use case of the keys, as not all keys run on OTP protocols.

Go-to-market strategy

Over time, Yubico has managed to reach a what we would consider to be a distinctive position
in the US technology sector, where major companies such as Amazon, Google and Microsoft use
YubiKeys to protect sensitive information. Not only has its footprint managed to grow within
the technology sector, but the company now also serves industries such as financial services,
manufacturing, retail, governments and the wider public sector. Data from Yubico shows that, at
the end of 2022, more than a quarter of G2000 companies had deployed YubiKeys in their
organisations, to a varying degree.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

What is interesting to us about Yubico’s go-to-market strategy is that it is often the case that the
IT department or a technology heavy department in a customer’s organisation is either trying out
YubiKeys or a person at those departments uses YubiKeys in their private life. These users then
often develop a preference for the YubiKeys, often due to the high security level combined with
ease of use, and subsequently tend to ‘push’ the usage upstream within the organisation, as we
have understood it. Another trend that has been visible for Yubico is that many customers tend
to initially only use the YubiKeys internally, and later expand to a larger part of the value chain,
for example vendors, consultants and its own customers. We understand this to mean that in
many cases the company requires a larger part of its value chain to increase their security level, or
just by recommendation of the product.
The sales pitch is typically not very complicated, as Yubico is targeting the root cause of 9 of 10
cybersecurity breaches – stolen credentials – and to date there have been no breaches of accounts
protected by YubiKeys, according to the company. In the grand scheme of things, we consider it
a very affordable sanitary solution for increased cyber protection. According to a report by
Forrester in which it interviewed five security leaders from organisations that use YubiKeys, by
deploying YubiKeys the companies could block phishing and credential theft attempts by 99.9%
which in turn yielded a USD2.2m benefit over a three-year period. In summary, organisations
that invested USD1.6m in costs for YubiKeys experienced USD4.8m in benefits over a threeyear period and an ROI of 203%, according to the same study.

Yubico primarily targets enterprises (as an example, the minimum enterprise subscription is 500
YubiKeys) but the YubiKey’s benefit, and are used by, small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs)
and consumers as well. The company has an internal sales force which manages the enterprise
sales, while the SMBs and consumers primarily are served through Yubico’s web shop and a
worldwide distributor and reseller network. Yubico classifies its authorised resellers into three
categories where the main difference is how well trained the personnel are on Yubico’s products.
Some of the Gold Certified Resellers are Arctic Group, Kocho, MTRIX GmbH and SecMaker.
Other than the more traditional sales channels mentioned above, Yubico also has an affiliate
programme in which affiliates earn a 10% commission on all orders made through their link
(within seven days from clicking on the link).

Customers

Yubico has established a large and impressive list of customers, consisting of thousands of
organisations and more than 15m product users across more than 160 countries. The company
has a broad reach and targets organisations of all sizes, ranging from large enterprises and
governmental organisations to SMBs and individuals. Yubico has managed to expand on its
strong relationships started with leading tech companies during its early years, and today finds 19
of the world’s 20 largest tech companies among its customer list, which we see as strong validation
of the product and use case.

The potential use case is broad, and Yubico’s customers can be found within any industry, but
the company has especially established itself as a leading provider of authentication solutions to
companies within the technology sector, financial services and government organisations where
there generally are high risks related to cyber-attacks. Hence, we think it is clear that Yubico has
established itself as a trusted brand globally with a large blue-chip customer base.
We believe the interest from government organisations will increase further following the US
government’s mandate in 2022 to transition digital infrastructure to “Phising Resistant MFA”
systems by 2024, where FIDO/WebAuthn could take on the role as the next-gen phishing
protection. In the sections below, we have aimed to illustrate two case studies we believe
showcase how impressive the customer list is and also the usability of the Yubico offering.

Case study 1 – Google and Yubico

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Google was one of Yubico’s first and most important customers. Following several cyber-attacks
targeting Google in 2009, Google started working with Yubico to improve its security controls.
The two parties started working on improving the capabilities of the YubiKey’s two-factor
authentication to also include public key cryptography, which resulted in a new strong
authentication protocol that later become an open standard adopted by the FIDO (“Fast IDentity
Online”) Alliance.
After having evaluated various authentication methods, such as one-time passwords, TLS
certificates, and smart cards, over two years, Google reached the conclusion that the FIDO U2F
Security Keys were best suited for its internal needs, resulting in an expansion of the distributed
YubiKeys to its staff, resulting in more than 50,000 employees using the YubiKey.
Google’s evaluation found the following advantages by adopting the YubiKey and FIDO U2F:
• Improved security – Accounts have experienced significant increases in the level of security.
• Accelerated productivity – Time needed to authenticate using a YubiKey compared to a onetime password is almost 50% lower. Compared to Google Authenticator, logins could now
be nearly four times faster.
• Less need for support and lower cost of ownership – Compared to phone-based solutions,
YubiKeys were found to be easier to use and more robustly designed. Google saw support
incidents drop by 92%, resulting in significantly lower support costs. The evaluation further
found that authentication failures are zero.

Yubico

Altogether, the evaluation concluded that YubiKey enabled heightened security and increased
productivity at a lower cost.
Google’s use of YubiKey did not stop with it internal accounts. The company has also made
YubiKey and the FIDO U2F security keys available tools for all Google users. Google has also
emphasised the advantages of using the YubiKey to protect Adwords accounts, altogether
reflecting that Yubico has become an important technology partner to Google.

Case study 2 – CERN deploying YubiKey to secure most critical assets

The European Organisation for Nuclear Research, CERN, is using YubiKeys to secure access to
critical assets by protecting admin accounts and server access, which is important given the access
to computing services and accelerators’ operations. CERN had an interest in finding a Two-factor
authentication (2FA) solution that could be deployed for users with minimal backend
requirements. The YubiKey proved beneficial in allowing employees to maintain using devices
of their own choice (Linux, Mac, Windows) with a seamless protection standard that further
allowed CERN to maintain its own deployments on the server side.

Yubico vs eID

Electronic Identification (eID) is what it sounds like, an electronic way to secure someone’s
identity without a physical identification. All organisations delivering public digital services in an
EU member state are required to accept eIDs and there are several countries outside of the EU
that also utilise eIDs, such as Chile, Mexico and India. In Sweden the most common eID is
BankID/Mobil BankID (owned by several Swedish banks) and it is possible to add face
recognition as an authentication option instead of a number combination. It is not only used for
public digital services but also for logging into the Avanza mobile app or Tele2 mobile app, just
to mention a few possible use cases.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

In some use cases, eID is a viable option to YubiKeys and provides increased security as an MFA
alternative, we believe. However, as it often is based on a mobile application and not on a physical
hardware device, we think it shares some of the flaws of other software-based MFA alternatives
such as being easier to breach. As far as we know, eIDs are generally not supported by many
software and applications, and to use it in an enterprise environment would be more troublesome
to set up compared to YubiKeys, we believe.
On the Faroe Islands, Yubico is part of the eID solution, where the YubiKey 5 Series can be used
instead of the mobile application. We see the potential for similar solutions in other countries as
well, but consider this to be mere upside potential rather than having any expectations of it.

Overview of the authentication landscape

We argue that as some of the most prominent technology companies in the world, such as
Google, Microsoft and Amazon, use YubiKeys, then YubiKeys must be regarded as one the best
MFA solutions available. Naturally, Yubico is not the only company in the world that offers MFA
solutions, nor is it alone in offering hardware MFA solutions. According to Yubico, the
competitors in the market can be split into three key segments:
• Pure play advanced authentication providers, such as Yubico, focus on advanced
authentication and a passwordless user experience. These companies primarily offer a type of
hardware MFA security key, including biometric and nearfield communication (NFC)
solutions. Few companies offer products beyond hardware, but it could also include
distribution to companies and integration with other identity security solutions.
• Broader identity solution providers offer mobile phone message or mobile phone push-based
MFA solutions. Generally, these providers have larger and more bundled portfolios of broad
cybersecurity solutions, of which the majority is focused on single sign-on (SSO) solutions
provided across a wide range of applications and devices. Companies in this category include
Duo, Fortinet, Microsoft and Okta.
• Traditional authentication providers offer early-generation login security solutions such as
physical token authentication solutions which have a small display that shows the generated
codes for the login. This category also includes personal identity verification (e.g. smart cards
with stored credentials or cryptographic keys) developed for financial and government use
based on smart card readers. Even though Yubico primarily exists in the ‘pure play advanced
authentication providers’ segment, it also covers this category due to the multi-protocol
functionality of YubiKeys. This enables its customers to cover their legacy needs while
transitioning to more modern authentication solutions.

The many types of authentication methods have varying levels of impregnability, complexity, cost
and ease of use. A common way of multi-factor identification which many probably recognise is
the use of SMS codes, ‘press-a-link-via-email’, or even verification through a third-party mobile
app. These methods of MFA are typically fairly easy to use and are widely used. According to a
study by Yubico, mobile SMS-based authentication is used by 33% of people as the authentication
method. However, these methods are not the best in terms of resistance to phishing or hacking.
On the other side of the spectrum are smart cards, which typically offer a higher level of security
but tend to be more complex to integrate in specific software or applications and are far more
expensive. The YubiKey offers a level of security in line with traditional smart cards, as we
understand it, but are as easy to use as an SMS code verification, if not even easier. Our experience
is that the security versus ease of use equation tends to be difficult to solve, and in most current
solutions one of the parameters suffers at the expense of the other.

Examples of other MFA hardware security keys

Below we have described other well-known MFA hardware security keys that from a consumer’s
perspective appear to be a substitute for the YubiKey and in what way they differ.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Despite Google being a customer of Yubico and using YubiKeys, it has developed its own MFA
hardware key called Titan Security Keys. One of the main differences between the two keys, as
we understand it, is that the YubiKeys support a wider range of safety protocols and standards,
such as FIDO2, which means it is more secure and has more use-cases. In terms of appearance,
the keys seem to be very similar. However, we note that there are far more models of the YubiKey
serving different purposes, compared to Google’s Titan Keys. The Titan Key has got some
backlash due to production in China in the past. We have not found any newer information on
production today, but we note this has been an issue for consumers previously at least.
Feitian, the Chinese company, has its own Feitian Security Keys. The keys look similar to the
YubiKeys and share several of the same security features and protocols. Given its origins, we
believe consumers have been wary of the Feitian Security Keys and that they are manufactured
in China. We believe this is mainly an issue in the eyes of larger corporations which cannot risk
any security incidents, but also for private consumers. The Feitian keys are generally a cheaper
option to the YubiKey and probably cater to a different customer segment.
SoloKeys are the first open-source FIDO2 security keys, which means they allow developers to
contribute to the continuous development of the project and locating bugs etc. Our impression
is that SoloKeys target tech-savvy developers more than large enterprise clients, being a more
affordable security key with the optionality to use the key for the developers’ own projects for
example. In comparison, we believe the YubiKey is more user-friendly and has a more robust
design.

Forecasts
We have based our forecasts on Yubico’s official annual reports and quarterly reports. Yubico
has only issued two quarterly reports. The company’s annual financial information is currently
prepared in accordance with Swedish accounting standard BFNAR 2021:1 (K3), but management
has committed to switching to the IFRS standard in conjunction with the move from the First
North Listing venue to the main market in Stockholm, which it plans at some point. The main
differences between K3 and IFRS are how R&D and leasing expenses are treated, and the switch
will not have an impact on sales, EBIT and EPS.

Yubico’s financial targets are to increase bookings by a CAGR of 25% and to have an EBIT
margin of 20%. There is no time or date attached to the targets, which suggests to us that the
company wants to achieve the targets every year. We note that Yubico’s track record of organic
sales growth is significantly stronger than the target of 25% per year, with a sales CAGR(16–22)
of close to 50%. However, EBIT margins have consistently (except for 2016) been below its 20%
target. After an investment phase in 2019–21, Yubico turned profitable on the bottom line in
2022 and reported an EBIT margin of 13.8%.

In its Q1(23) report Yubico provided the following guidance for 2023, which was reiterated in
full in its Q2(23) report:
• Booking growth for full year 2023 may be somewhat short of the long-term target of a 25%
CAGR.
• EBIT margin for 2023 of 5–15%, depending on development of subscription sales.
Yubico has a straightforward business model based on sale of its YubiKeys. Initially the company
only used a perpetual sales method, which is essentially a traditional hardware sales model. The
customer buys a YubiKey without any time restrictions. This is a simple, transparent proposition
with no hidden costs for the customer. The advantage of this model for Yubico is that it receives
cash up front and is not burdened with long-term commitments.
In 2020 Yubico launched its subscription service, YubiEnterprise Service (YES), which is
primarily aimed at enterprises with more than a couple of hundred users. With this hardware-asa-service, organisations can upgrade to the latest version of YubiKeys as they become available,
get a discount for purchasing backup keys, and access priority support. The advantages of
subscriptions for the company are that they give Yubico more predictable revenue and a closer
customer relationship. However, selling subscriptions is more difficult and it had a negative
impact on gross margins in the first year.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Subscription sales grew by 143% in 2022 and subscription bookings were about 15% of total
bookings. Yubico said in the Q1(23) report that it strives to increase the share of subscriptions,
which normally have a contract period of three years.
We welcome Yubico reporting annual recurring revenue (ARR) because it increases the
transparency of the subscription sales performance and outlook. ARR is defined as contract value
related to subscription contracts as of the end of the reporting period, excluding one-time fees,
divided by the term of the contract on a rolling 12-month basis. In Q1(23) ARR grew by 67%
Y/Y to SEK219m, which was about 13% of annualised Q1 sales for the group. In Q2, ARR grew
by 55% Y/Y, also around 13% of annualised sales.

The diagram below depicts Yubico’s strong sales trajectory since 2016, which is driven by organic
growth. The company has not made any acquisitions. Yubico’s sales grew by 61% in 2022,
adjusted for FX effects, with the strongest growth seen in the Americas region at 99%, or about
81% adjusted for FX.

In our view, the most important sales drivers are the ongoing high threat of cyber-attacks for
organisations and private individuals, and the growth of the advanced authentication market.
IDC, an IT consultancy, expects this market to grow by about 14–15% per year in 2023–24. We
also think it is possible for Yubico to strengthen its market share in the advanced authentication
market, given its competitive offering and strong track record. Yubico’s market share was about
0.4% in 2022. We elaborate more on the market drivers in the Cybersecurity market section of
this report.

region generated 75% of group sales in 2022 and we estimate that sales growth was about 81%,
excluding FX effects.
The US is the world’s largest cybersecurity market, and it is therefore natural that it continues to
dominate Yubico’s sales. However, we see potential for the company to grow too in Europe and
Asia, over time.

We think Yubico’s sales channels look well developed with a broad range of distributors, resellers
and online retailers in place. That said, it should be possible to further develop the channel
partners and routes to customers. One interesting example is how German IT reseller Bechtle
has successfully sold YubiKeys to several Germany organisations, including BMW and
Volkswagen. Yubico said that BMW adopted YubiKeys broadly in its organisation over a short
period of time, while other organisations have taken a bit longer.
In June 2022, Yubico announced that the YubiKey will be available on AWS Marketplace, a
curated digital catalogue that customers can use to find, buy and deploy third-party software, data
and services. This is an example of how the company continues to develop its go-to-market
strategy, supporting our view that there is probably more potential to further improving its sales
methods.
The most important sales channel is Yubico’s own web site, which generates about 20% of sales
according to the company. The margins are also higher on this channel as Yubico does not have
to split the sales price with other channel partners.

Bookings typically exceed sales, although this has reversed recently. In LTM Q2(23), the bookings
were lower than the LTM sales, due to a very large order in Q2(22). For comparisons, we have
excluded the large order in the second chart below. This unusually large order will now no longer
affect the comparisons.

EMEA is the second largest region for Yubico, and we think the management team expects it to
follow the higher adoption rate of YubiKeys that the American market has. Q1 is usually a strong
quarter for EMEA, where many resellers stock up with YubiKeys for several months ahead. We
think the growth rate for Q1(23) looks unusually high, so we have estimated a sales decline in
Q1(24) for this region, explaining the somewhat lower group growth that we estimate for this
quarter.

Subscription bookings have ramped up well since Yubico introduced this model in 2020. But
despite the good growth in subscription revenue, subscriptions are still only a smaller part of the

growth will be quick, adding more stability and visibility.

The diagrams below show Yubico’s sales compared with bookings, or order intake. We can see
that bookings were higher than sales in the past three years, but that the book-to-bill trended
downwards from 2020 to 2022. In Q1(23) order intake was even lower than sales, and our
calculations suggest that this was also the case in H2(22).
In a normal situation we believe sales and bookings should be quite similar, as it only takes Yubico
about two weeks to deliver an order. Larger orders do often take longer time to deliver, and lead
times can increase if the order has to be shipped to several different locations, for example to
home offices. Some orders can take up to a year to deliver. The company defines a large order as
over USD1m.

The revenue model’s ongoing and high share of perpetual sales suggests to us that volume growth
and increased penetration are important revenue drivers. Increased penetration of YubiKeys in
organisations seems to have worked very well for the company since its inception thanks to a
successful land-and-expand sales strategy.
Yubico said during its Q1(23) conference call that it delivered about 6m YubiKeys in 2022, and
a total of slightly more than 22m since inception. We have no more detail on volume than this,
neither on an annual nor a quarterly basis.
From the data above, we can calculate that the average selling price (ASP) in 2022 was about
EUR24.5. The list prices range from EUR25–105. Yubico has confirmed that its ASP is in the
ballpark of EUR24–25 and we therefore conclude that volumes are probably highest at the lower
end of the YubiKey product range, that distributors and resellers take a share of the price, and
that large customers receive volume discounts on larger orders.
Yubico has not changed its prices much historically, but we believe it did increase them in 2020
and again in Q1(23). We believe prices will now remain quite stable at close to their current levels.

We only have limited information about Yubico’s quarterly operating performance. The company
issued its first quarterly report on 8 May 2023 and there are limited historical figures available.
However, the company has provided a semi-annual split of its bookings since 2020, which shows
that order intake is typically stronger in the second half each year. About 40% of bookings are
generated in H1 and about 60% in H2.

A very large order of about SEK239m in Q2(22), 39% of bookings in the quarter, distorted this
seasonal pattern during 2022. The order was fully delivered at the end of 2022, which supported
revenue growth in H2(22). A back-of-the-envelope calculation suggests that the order was for
about 375,000 YubiKeys to some 185,000 employees, if we assume that every employee receives
two keys. This calculation is based on an ASP of EUR50. Using the average ASP of EUR24.5
would of course double the number of keys that the order contained.

Yubico has guided for negative bookings growth for Q2(23) due to the tough comparisons, but
expects good growth in H2(23), which was the case in the Q2 report. Bookings declined by 29%

Another conclusion we can make is that underlying organic growth was about 35% in 2022, if we
exclude the large order in Q2(22). This puts a new perspective on our sales forecast of SEK1.9bn
for 2023. Our organic growth forecast for 2023 is 15%, well below the target of 25%. However,
on a more like-for-like, underlying basis our forecast is 33%. We would not rule out more large
orders like the one Yubico received in 2022, but they are not part of our base case estimates.

Our base case revenue growth forecasts are below Yubico’s financial targets of 25% per year. The
diagram below is the implied number of YubiKeys delivered per year and our estimates until
2025e, based on a flat ASP of EUR24.5.
Yubico’s financial target means that the company aims to deliver about 7.2m units in 2023 (20%
growth), 9.0m in 2024 (25% growth) and 11.7m in 2025 (25% growth).

We have done a simplified scenario calculation to show how replacement of YubiKeys is affecting
new product sales. Yubico has highlighted that a 20% replacement rate per year is a normal
assumption in its subscription contracts. The key replacement rate covers computer upgrades,
loss of security keys, and employee turnover.
The two diagrams below are based on 10% and 20% rates per year and assume that a key lasts
four years in total. After the fourth year we have assumed that a new sale for an existing user
would be necessary. This shows that the required new volumes per year declines substantially but
is still high compared with deliveries during 2019–21.

We take a closer look at the perpetual revenue model compared to a SaaS model in the
cybersecurity industry later in this report to analyse Yubico’s dependence on new sales and
increased penetration.
Yubico shipped about 6m YubiKeys in 2022 and the US market was about 75% of its sales. We
have summarised a few of Yubico’s customers in the table below, and their employee bases, to
get some perspective on the number of keys that were delivered. We believe that a user typically
has at least two keys and the replacement rete is probably about 10–20%.
As of the end of 2022, 26% of all entrants on the Forbes Global 2000 list of the largest companies
in the world had deployed YubiKeys in their organisations, to some degree.

To give a bit more context to the delivery volumes, we have looked at the number of employees
at several US companies and studied data from the US Bureau of Labor Statistics. The graphs
below are two examples that show that the US government, a key customer group for Yubico,
employs a total of about 22m people in various organisations and authorities. The total number
of employees in all financial institutions in the US is about 9m, according to the US Bureau of
Labor Statistics.

Yubico’s subscription sales were SEK141m in 2022, accounting for 9% of sales. Order intake of
subscription sales in 2022 was higher at SEK242m, while ARR stood at SEK205m at the end of
2022. The ARR increased to SEK219m at the end of Q1(23), which means that subscription sales
will most likely be an important revenue driver for the group in 2023. The ARR numbers point
to at least 55% Y/Y subscriber growth in 2023.
The graph below shows a calculation of the revenue impact of the order booking cohorts per
year since 2020. We have assumed that revenue in one year starts the year after the order was
received, and that the contract length is three years. We have also assumed that a cohort continues
with a 100% retention rate after the contract has expired, i.e. that the subscription orders in 2020
continue unchanged in 2024. New subscription contracts will be an important value driver for
Yubico, in our view, as they increase visibility for the company. Another important reason to
keep track of subscriber growth is that it impacts gross margins.

Gross margins

Yubico is operating with strong gross margins of above 80%, which implies to us that the
company has an efficient business model, production methods, and high value added at the
current price points. Increasing sales is therefore a key value driver for Yubico. However, high
incremental margins work both ways and a fall in volumes would have a very negative effect on
profitability.
We expect continued solid organic growth for perpetual sales and a gradually increasing share of
subscription services for Yubico, and therefore a relatively stable gross margin, during our
forecast period until 2025.

Gross margin
Source: Company data, Carnegie Research

Perpetual and subscription sales have different gross margin profiles, and it is therefore important
to monitor the mix effects. Net sales in a subscription contract are evenly booked over the
contract period, while direct costs are booked after they are incurred, which means approximately
70% in year one and 15% in each of the next two years. This means that EBIT is lower in year
one and higher in the following two years compared to the perpetual business model, where 100%
of net sales and cost are booked when the keys are delivered.
We have made a calculation in the table below of how the gross margins are impacted by
differences in sales mix, based on Yubico’s information about its revenue and COGS recognition.
The sales input for perpetual sales is indexed to 100 and a subscription is half of that. This means
that we have assumed that Yubico receives bookings of 150 in year one, and that 100 perpetual
sales are recognised directly while subscription sales are 16.7 per year for three years. We have
also assumed that both revenue streams have the same gross margin during the total contact, i.e.

85% for both offerings. This is broadly in line with Yubico’s reported gross margin in 2022 of
84.3%.

This calculation shows that the gross margin on subscription sales is about 68% and has a negative
impact on the total gross margin of about -2.5%-points, all else being equal. However, in the
second year the subscription margin improves to about 93%. The important part is therefore to
monitor new subscription sales and how large the contract portfolio is.

The table below shows the gross margin for the group based on the simplified assumptions we
made in the table above, and other gross margin assumptions for subscription revenue and the
mix effect. Yubico needs subscriber contracts in year one to be on a par with the subscription
sales that year in order to reach a mix of 25% subscriber sales – i.e. very large contracts.

Yubico

We note that the calculation clearly shows that the gross margin is sensitive to new subscription
contracts. However, the base of contracts is also growing steadily, which reduces the dilutive
effect on group margins.
Yubico is guiding for an EBIT margin of 5–15% for 2023, depending on the development of
subscription sales. This is a puzzling statement in our view, considering that Q1(23) had a gross
margin of 86.3%, up 2.1%-points Y/Y. We also note that subscription bookings were relatively
soft at SEK27m, or 7.7% of total bookings. The historical track record and our calculation above
also show that it is unlikely that the gross margin will deviate by as much as 10%-points. This
suggests to us that the guidance is overly cautious, and that the EBIT margin probably will be in
the high end of the range.

Operating costs

YubiKey had an EBIT margin of 13.8% in 2022, which was an improvement from -7.7% in 2021.
This margin improvement came from high sales growth, a gross margin increase of 2.5%-points,
and more positive Other operating income, which is mainly FX valuation effects.
The operating cost structure is relatively straightforward, it is essentially personnel expenses and
other operating costs. Yubico is evaluating a transition to reporting costs by function when it
changes where it is listed.

R&D expenses are not reported separately, but Yubico has reported that it has about 60 engineers
(~15% of total headcount) working on the technological development of hardware, software and
services within the parent company and its subsidiary in the US. All R&D costs are taken directly
in the P&L, i.e. the company does not capitalise any development expenses and therefore has no
capitalised assets. We also note that there is a seasonal effect on staff costs in H2, when sales
bonuses are paid to sales staff.

Yubico had an average of 390 employees in 2022, which was 100 more than in 2021, or 34%
headcount growth. We believe that Yubico intends to increase its headcount further and we see
no indication of a slowdown in the expansion. That said, the current EBIT margin, compared
with the financial target of reaching 20% EBIT margins, suggest that the number of employees
will grow more slowly than sales going forward.

While Other operating income is not a relevant value driver, we think it is important to note that
it was a sizeable share of revenue in 2021 and 2022, at 3.4% and 4.6%, respectively. Some 96–
98% of this is related to FX gains of operating assets and liabilities and should therefore have a
much smaller positive effect in 2023e given the current USD/SEK rate.

Margins and EBIT

Yubico is guiding for an EBIT margin of 5–15% for 2023, depending on the development of
subscription sales. Our forecast for 2023e is an EBIT margin of 17%, which is above the guidance
range. Although we are already forecasting above the guidance range, we think there is further
upside potential to our margin forecast from higher sales than we expect. But we think a prudent
approach is relevant in this case due to the relatively low order intake growth since mid-2022,
lack of quarterly financial data and tough comparisons in Q2(23).

We believe that the bookings growth guidance suggests sales growth of slightly below 25%, about
20–24%. This means that the company’s EBIT guidance is very broad, stretching from about
SEK94m to SEK290m. The area within the dotted line in the table below shows the implied
EBIT range from Yubico’s guidance for 2023 and the company’s comments in connection to the
Q2(23) report. Our EBIT forecast for 2023 is SEK323m.
The low end of the guidance, i.e. an EBIT margin of 5%, implies expectations of very large
subscription orders. Although this could happen, we think the start of the year and our gross
margin calculations above point to a very low likelihood of an EBIT margin as low as 5% only
due to a mix effect, as we described in the section above. However, in its Q2(23) report, Yubico
commented on its guidance, stating that the margin range remains, but that the margin would
likely be in “the upper end” of the range for the full year.

In summary, we believe that Yubico will continue to perform well in 2023e, with solid underlying
organic growth and stable EBIT margins due to tough comparisons, particularly in Q2(23).

Balance sheet and working capital

The acquisition and listing of Yubico will be accounted for as a reverse acquisition, meaning that
it will not create any goodwill. Yubico’s current balance sheet will therefore also be the starting
point for the listed company.
Looking at the balance sheet for 2022 in the tables below, we note that it is a straightforward
setup where the asset side is dominated by cash, receivables and inventories. The other side of
the balance sheet is dominated by shareholders’ equity, payables and accrued expenses and
deferred income.

We think that Yubico’s strong balance sheet has the potential to get even stronger during our
forecast period until 2025e thanks to positive operating results and relatively low investments.
The net cash position was SEK371m at the end of Q2(23).

Yubico had positive working capital of about SEK387m at the end of 2022, which was 21% of
sales. Working capital has increased steadily since 2016, with a significant increase in 2022 due to
sharply higher trade receivables.

The diagrams below show the key components of Yubico’s working capital. Inventories were
quite stable in 2021 and even declined in 2022, despite the global supply chain issues and
component shortages. The largest part of the non-IB liabilities is accrued expenses and deferred
income. We believe that the increase since 2020 stems from subscriptions sales, which are paid
upfront. It could also be connected to perpetual orders taken late in the year but delivered at the
beginning of the following year.

We note that trade receivables have been varying quite a lot in the past few years. We expect
receivables to be about 20% of sales going forward. Inventories increased significantly compared
to sales in 2019–21 but came down to 10.8% in 2022. Inventories currently look fairly low in
absolute terms and compared to sales, but it is important to remember that Yubico is operating
with high gross margins and COGS is only about 15–16% of sales.

The charts below depict working capital measured in days, and so we have used the average per
year and compared inventories and payables with COGS rather than sales. Inventories stand out
in this calculation as they cover two years of COGS. So, we conclude that Yubico should have
good experience of mitigating significant shortage problems from a top-down perspective. That
said, missing only one component or part could of course still lead to production delays. We think
that inventory levels are not a cause for concern as the company operates with high gross margins,
and revenue growth is a much more important value driver than optimal working capital.

Our conclusion from the working capital analysis above is also supported by our ROIC analysis
in the diagram below. We can see that Yubico has high capital turnover thanks to low fixed noncurrent assets. Even with an EBIT margin of 17% for 2023e, well below the target of 20%, the
company would be highly profitable in ROIC terms.

Yubico has been financed with internally generated cash flow and share issues that have totalled
about SEK768m since 2016. Investments have generally been low, and the company has not
capitalised any development expenses. Tangible investments are primarily in its production
capacity in outsourced production. In the 2021 and 2022 annual reports Yubico stated that it
increased its production capacity through investments in new production robots and increased
automation. In 2022, the company also increased its programming capacity and added more
electronic manufacturing (EMS) suppliers.

Q1(23) report

In Q1(23) Yubico’s bookings grew by 14.9%, or 3% adjusted for FX, to SEK350m. Subscription
bookings were 7.7% of total bookings, which corresponds to SEK27m. Sales grew by 27% to
SEK419m which is organic growth of 17.3%. Subscription sales were SEK52m compared to
SEK19m last year, and ARR was SEK219m at the end of Q1(23).
The gross margin was a strong 86.3%, compared with 84.2% last year. The EBIT margin came
in at 17.5%. This compares with the guidance of 5–15% EBIT margin for the full-year 2023.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

We regard Yubico’s Q2(23) report as strong. Bookings declined Y/Y by 29%, but this was widely
expected by the market because of the strong bookings number in Q2(22). Yubico has also on
several occasions told the market that bookings would be “weak” in Q2(23). However, bookings
grew by over 16% Q/Q. Subscription bookings were 15% of total bookings. Sales grew 23%
Y/Y, helped by FX. On a constant currency basis, sales grew 16%, largely in line with Q1(23).
ARR was SEK243m at the end of Q2, up 11% Q/Q. The gross margin was 86%, compared to
85% last year. The EBIT margin was 22%, up from 17% last year. Yubico reiterated their margin
guidance of 5-15%, as they did in Q1. The guidance for bookings was also the same as it was in
Q1: bookings growth for full-year 2023 may fall short of the long-term financial target.

The problem with penetration cases

In this sector, there are different company types and different business models. As we see it, there
is always an issue with hardware penetration cases and the long-term growth potential when
compared to SaaS cases.
We have illustrated this in the following charts (note that the figures are merely illustrative) – on
the left side is Yubico stand-in, and on the right side, a SaaS based cybersecurity company, such
as Crowdstrike. We have assumed the two companies below – we call them Yubico and Cybersec
SaaS – both start with revenue of 100 in year one, and then we assume that they grow by 30%
annually until year 12. So far, they look identical in terms of sales progression, and they also look
identical also when we look at the net new revenue per year as well.

Net new revenue
Source: Carnegie Research

It is when we look at the source of revenue that the hardware penetration issue kicks in. The
nature of a SaaS business is that once a customer is landed, it sticks for a very long time, or even
perpetually. This is not true for all SaaS businesses, but it is true for the high-quality ones, which
rarely lose any customers, such as Crowdstrike.
For Yubico to grow 30%, assuming a base of 100 in revenue in year one, it would need to sell for
130 in year two. In this example we assume that Yubico has no subscription services, which is a
simplification as a portion of its revenue is recurring. SaaSco, on the other hand, only needs to
sell for 30, because the 100 they have in base is contracted and recurring – unless the customer
chooses a new vendor, they will have the base 100 also in year two. In year three, they need to
sell for ‘only’ 39, whereas Yubico will need to sell for 169, which we think is a big difference.
One can put it in another way – the revenue that Yubico would theoretically generate in year
eight is more the accumulated revenue of years 1–4, whereas the net new revenue for Crowdstrike
in year eight is similar to the revenue level of year one. Because the base is ‘reset’ every year, it
becomes more challenging for the hardware-based company, we think. We think that this is one
of the bear arguments to the case. While it is relevant, we believe the view is too pessimistic, as it
does not consider the replacement cycle on top of penetration of keys. We would like to present
another approach to this view in the next section.

Case study: hardware replacement cycle

When talking about replacements of YubiKeys, Yubico often refers to two factors: 1) staff churn
resulting in the need for replacement keys; and 2) the loss of the physical key due to human error.
We also see a third reason for replacing existing YubiKeys: updated versions supporting a wider
range of protocols and improved safety. We have a few references to Reddit in this section. We
acknowledge that this is not a trusted source, so we base no conclusions on the posts from Reddit,
but we do think they add some interesting reflections on the use of YubiKeys.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Durability is probably not a reason for replacement…

Source: Twitter and Reddit

Yubico has not disclosed information on the lifespan of its keys. From the information that we
have collected primarily from user reviews and discussions in diverse forums online or from news
articles, YubiKeys seem to be overall robust and durable with no moving parts or battery. Most
evidence we found suggests that the average YubiKey should serve its purpose for around 7–12
years before the hardware malfunctions. However, there is a security aspect from holding on to
a YubiKey for too long. As with most software applications, hardware requires upgrades to keep
it up to date and to fix earlier security concerns. In addition to new security features from Yubico
itself, the keys are continuously being upgraded with additional integrations to other security
services, providing extra safety and flexibility for users. As YubiKeys are at the forefront of
authentication safety, we believe Yubico’s user base is to a large extent tech-savvy and prioritises
the security aspect. Consequently, we believe most YubiKey users would not be willing to
compromise on security by retaining their keys for an extended period and therefore are likely to
replace their YubiKey every few years. In the tech world seven years is already a lengthy period
of time, and the landscape for cybersecurity could become very different in that time.

Since data is limited regarding the replacement cycle of a YubiKey, we have investigated more
familiar ground, namely routers and smartphones, to get a feeling for the durability. Although the
comparison is by no means perfect, routers and smartphones share some critical elements with a
YubiKey. Firstly, they are all made of hardware but run with software, and secondly, the need for
security is crucial in all three devices. According to Statista, the average smartphone replacement
cycle lasts for ~2.7 years in the US and has steadily decreased since 2018. To better understand
the general durability of personal hardware equipment, the chart below illustrates the replacement
cycle for several standard IT devices. A typical USB flash drive generally lasts ~10 years and a
hard drive typically for 3–5 years, according to the Guardian.

Again, we note some noticeable differences between a YubiKey and a smartphone, for example
a smartphone has a battery that can expire and a display that can break. In addition, one could
also make the case that a smartphone is considered by some to be a personal accessory or a trend
item, further spoiling the comparison somewhat. However, as stated above, both are pieces of
hardware with high requirements in terms of safety and both are dependent on updates to remain
fully protected. The structure of updates is very different, however, where a smartphone update
can be transferred through the cloud, but a YubiKey user must buy a new key to obtain the latest
features. While we do not argue that the average user will switch their YubiKey as often as a
smartphone, we do consider it a valid reference point for illustrating a lower bound of the
replacement cycle.
Looking at routers, which we believe to be probably the most accurate comparison to a YubiKey,
the internet seems to agree on an average replacement cycle of ~5 years. The duration is highly
dependent on several variables, where the number of devices connected and heat stress are some
of the more common explanations for router malfunction. A router, in contrast to a YubiKey,
but like a smartphone, regularly receives updates for a few years after purchase. However, as a
router gets old, typically after around five years (but depending on the supplier), it is no longer
able to receive firmware updates, leaving the router vulnerable to hackers aiming to hijack data
transferred through the network and enabling them to access connected devices. According to
Consumerreports.org, even if the router appears to be working, it should be replaced if it is not
receiving firmware updates – in other words, no updates mean no security.
18 September 2023

47

c

Yubico

Why we highlight this is simple: we believe the same logic should apply to a YubiKey. As a
YubiKey is disconnected from the outside world, it receives no updates. While it is this isolation
that makes YubiKey much harder to hack than, i.e. a router, it can also become a liability as
hackers increase their efficiency. Yubico cannot update existing YubiKeys remotely to meet new
threats or add better integrations. What it can do is to develop new keys that are better than their
predecessor and make a new sale. Our point is the following: we believe that there is a third
reason for replacement, namely security, and that this factor further increases the overall share of
replacement revenue in Yubico’s revenue mix. We argue that this aspect further decreases the
volatility in sales, enabling Yubico to make recurring sales to its existing customer stock more
frequently. We also expect the replacement cycle, like in the case of smartphones illustrated
above, to shorten further over time as we anticipate new threats within the cybersecurity space
to accelerate exponentially.
We are generally not overly enthusiastic about penetration cases, preferring business models with
recurring revenue. Yubico is largely a penetration play, and continued growth will require more
and more effort compared to, i.e. a SaaS business which gets recurring revenue much more easily.
However, we find the insight mentioned above on replacements to be supportive for our
estimates, providing increased stability in the sales development. Additionally, replacement sales
to the existing customer base require significantly less in terms of customer acquisition costs,
further improving margins as the share of replacement sales makes up a more significant share
of the revenue mix.

In the charts below we illustrate the sales split of new volume versus replacement volume of
YubiKeys based on a 10% p.a. replacement rate related to churn and loss of keys, and a five-year
replacement cycle for the remaining keys. The duration of five years is based on our previous
analysis of the replacement cycle of other hardware devices, where a router, sharing many
similarities to a YubiKey, is replaced on average every five years. The five-year duration was also
the number highlighted by Yubico community members in a Reddit thread illustrated earlier in
this report, not because of the malfunctioning aspect but due to security reasons. Lastly, we have
assumed a perpetual customer relationship, meaning that we expect all previous customers to
switch their keys every five years in perpetuity. While we do not claim this to be a likely scenario,
as Yubico, without a doubt, will experience some churn, we make this assumption for simplicity
and illustrative purposes.

Our assumptions regarding the replacement cycle as presented above illustrate that the case is
less dependent on continued penetration only. In our view, the revenue stream over time is more
similar to a SaaS company but lumpier per client, as we estimate most keys are replaced every five
years rather than annually. As can be observed from the cohort chart below, Yubico still receives
revenue in 2030 from a customer acquired in 2016 under this assumption. Furthermore, there is
a volume spike every fifth year when a previous batch gets old and needs replacement. While
sales per client is lumpy, when aggregated over multiple clients and years, the combined portfolio

When assuming a consistent replacement cycle rate from 2016 to 2030 while keeping total volume
estimates unadjusted and using new volume sales as a residual, our observations indicate a gradual
increase in the proportion of replacement sales each year (see full calculations in the table below).
Again, we do not claim that Yubico’s business is recurring like in the SaaS model, but we consider
this exercise to represent an encouraging best-case scenario. It is well documented that people
lose their keys frequently and that hardware eventually needs replacement. Hence, the probability
of replacing these keys with a new Yubico product could arguably be considered high, in our
view. To summarise, even though the actual outcome is somewhere between this scenario and a
scenario with more notable churn, we find the replacement aspect an encouraging and essential
factor for Yubico to keep up its growth rate.

Yubico

Valuation and risks
There are many listed companies in several verticals of the cybersecurity market, and we use them
all in our relative valuation of Yubico. However, the listed players are all quite different in their
product offering and strategy compared to Yubico. Either they are primarily software based, or
primarily hardware based. They typically have different service sets, compared to Yubico which
is more concentrated in their offering. Our valuation is thus primarily based on a DCF approach,
given the uniqueness of Yubico, but we complement this by using the various cybersecurity peer
groups.
We have based our valuation on the estimates in the table below. Yubico has reported exceptional
sales and earnings momentum from 2018 to 2022 and we expect continued progress during our
forecast period, but with lower growth and with higher margins.

Relative valuation
Cybersecurity peers

For our relative valuation, we will look mainly at two groups: the listed cybersecurity companies,
and Swedish and Nordic IT/tech companies.
We have identified a total of 32 listed cybersecurity companies of varying size. We have included
them all in the table below, but we think that some players are more relevant than others.
Microsoft, for example, is actively pursuing the cybersecurity market, however, they are best
described as a software conglomerate as they are active in many different sectors. Crowdstrike,
however, can be considered a pure cybersecurity company, and is thus more relevant.
On average, the peer group trades on a 2024e EV/S of 5.9x and has an average EV/EBIT of
29x. The respective medians are 5.2x and 25x.

Below is a chart showing the average and median NTMA EV/S of the cybersecurity sector over
time. The overall sector average peaked at just above 14x in 2021 and has now dropped to around
6x.

The following chart shows the NTMA EV/EBIT over time instead. The average values jump
around a lot given the differences in profitability in the underlying companies. The average
NTMA EV/EBIT multiple is now just above 40x, while the median is around 30x.

Next, we have plotted the actual 2022 revenue for the different cybersecurity companies, and the
expected 2023e revenue. The charts show how there is an overall expectation of growth – most
companies listed below have, what we would categorise as significant growth rates.

We have also plotted the companies which we find most relevant in the sector, in a combined
chart to serve as a proxy for overall market growth. Y/Y growth rates have been close to or
exceeded 20% for 14 quarters in a row. For Q2(23), the growth rate decelerated to 19%, but we
still regard this as significant growth. We believe that this index could be used as a complement
for Yubico’s growth.

Regressions

We base our regressions on the peer groups we have defined earlier in this section – the
cybersecurity companies and the Nordic IT/tech companies. The first regressions we run are on
the Nordic IT/Tech companies, and we look at EV/S versus EBIT margins and EV/S versus
sales growth. These regressions return a suggested value of 5.3x and 7.4x EV/S for Yubico.

We believe that the most relevant peer regression is to look at ‘the rule of 40’, where we combine
sales growth with EBIT margin, and put that in relation to the EV/S. This representation results
in a fair multiple of 7.2x sales.

The following charts are the same regressions as above, only here we have used the cybersecurity
peers rather than the Nordic IT/Tech companies. The margin regression returns a suggested
EV/S of 7.3x and the sales growth regression returns a suggested multiple of 10.7x. We think
that the margin plot is too scattered and doesn’t show any correlation between the valuation and
the profitability. The growth plot is better, but this is also quite scattered.

In the chart below we again combine the revenue growth with the EBIT margin. This plot returns
a suggested multiple of 9.1x. It is less scattered than the margin plot, but similar to the sales plot.
We believe that this shows that there more to just growth and margins to explain the valuations
of these companies. As we have written this report, we have come to understand that investors
favour companies which they think have a strong position, be it with customers or with their
technology, which is a factor that regressions like this do not capture.

Yubico

DCF valuation

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

DCF valuation will be the main valuation approach for Yubico, given its uniqueness. While there
are companies that have similar revenue drivers and similar end-market exposure, Yubico is still
quite different from most of the peers we have compared it to. Below is a summary of our DCF
analysis and our assumptions. We arrive at a WACC of 9.8%, representing. With our assumptions
below, we arrive at a fair value of SEK130, our target price. We therefore think that it makes
sense to primarily rely on a DCF model, but to complement this with all the other valuation
approaches.

Yubico

Yubico’s role in the cybersecurity market
In this section we give an overview of the entire cybersecurity market – the types of threats and
attacks, those that Yubico can protect against, and those where it is not applicable. We summarise
what comprises endpoint security, network security, identity management, and everything in
between. We also highlight who we think are the key players in the market. We believe that this
overview creates a better understanding of Yubico’s position and its potential in relation to other
players in the market.
The colour matrix below is a key output from what has been written in the market sections. Pink
indicates that the companies are competing, yellow indicates that the companies are competing
on parts of the offering, and green means that the offerings complement each other. Our key
observation here is that Yubico can complement almost every security offering in the market. No
other security vendor has this position. On one hand, Yubico has a unique offering, but on the
other hand, it serves a small part of the market compared to the players that we have lifted. The
revenue potential in the listed companies exceeds what Yubico could ever reach, in our view.
While we think that the addressable market for Yubico is large – it offers significant runway for
growth – it is also niche when compared to what some other vendors want to achieve.

The company is in a position to partner with almost all security vendors in the market. Not only
that, but it is also possible to bundle an offering from Yubico with, for example, DataDog, which
has some offerings that are nascent to security, or with platforms like ServiceNow, where a
YubiKey can improve the offering by adding a strong layer of security at a low cost. We also
think that Yubico can use this position to be resold and integrated by other companies – it could
partner up with most of these players. We think that this is something Yubico’s sales team will
focus on in the coming years and which will be a growth driver.

In the table below, we have listed the most common types of cyber-attacks and how one can be
protected against them. In the beginning of the market section, we have given a detailed
explanation of each of these attacks and how they typically occur. We have not listed all vendors,
but instead selected those we think make most sense, such as market leaders in their respective
fields. Crowdstrike is often seen as one of the leaders in the new era of cybersecurity, and Palo
Alto as well, which has one of the largest portfolios when it comes to services. We have also
included Verisign, which in the matrix above has many green boxes, but it mainly provides
domain name registry services, meaning it is quite niche and its performance has limited effect
on Yubico. Authy is another company that may be seen as a competitor to Yubico (we outlined
before that Yubico is the safer service).
The table shows that no vendor has a conclusive offering – a strong safety framework requires
multiple services. While next-gen vendors like Crowdstrike have come a long way and offer many
things, they integrate well with Yubico, and their service is enhanced when they are added
together. The table also suggests that players like Crowdstrike take a pure software- and cloudbased approach to protection, compared to Yubico which is hardware-enabled. We think this is
an advantage that will protect Yubico from competition in the long-term from the next-gen
vendors.
Another finding of ours is that Yubico is a great alternative for those on a tight budget. By using
strict identity controls with Yubico as an authentication measure, a business can get robust
security for a low cost, without the need to go for an expensive software platform like
Crowdstrike.

Why are so many Tier 1 companies using Yubico?
In our estimates section we used the below table to highlight the growth potential of Yubico –
its growth is to a large extent driven by existing customers purchasing more keys, and it has a
presence with some very large employers, offering a solid growth runway. We believe another
aspect of the customer roster is that it can give an idea of the quality of a product. There are many
Tier 1 companies using Yubico. By Tier 1 we mean: 1) the company is a known innovator or
known for highly appreciated products, like Microsoft or Google; 2) the company has high
requirements for its vendors and suppliers; 3) it operates services that are critical and sensitive if

Yubico

breached, such as Mircosoft, AWS, Ping, Citrix or Cern; and 4) we believe that many investors
and companies look at these businesses and think that they are impressive and capable.
That these businesses rely on Yubico for their internal security proves the quality of Yubico’s
product, in our view. We also want to direct readers to the first part of this section, around
different security vendors and how Yubico can integrate and engage with all listed platforms. For
most of the companies in the matrix above, cross-platform integration is not possible. You do
not get to use one product from Crowdstrike and one from SentinelOne.
But there is another fact about Yubico’s openness as well – Yubico has a guide and a
recommendation on how to deploy a key, but they are not bound by it, as the other vendors. If
e.g. you have a Crowdstrike subscription, you have some customisability, but within certain
boundaries. Crowdstrike’s software works on set principles that cannot be changed. We do not
necessarily think that this is a problem for Crowdstrike, but we think that it could be limiting for
some of its customers.
Another example is Thales, which we have not listed in the matrix or the table. Thales offers an
authentication service but it requires its back-end software for key handling to be purchased as
well. Using such software implies vulnerabilities for breaches. Some companies might want to
have that control internally. Some might not want to have any system at all tied to the keys.
Yubico caters for all of this. It offers full customisability and programmability of the keys. At this
point, we do not consider Thales a competitor.

Yubico

The community effect
What do companies such as Apple, Tesla, Microsoft, Snowflake, Twilio, Nintendo, Lego,
Ubiquity, Fortnox, Valve, Plejd and Lucasfilm all have in common? They all have strong userbase
communities. Having a solid community comes with several benefits, and we argue that Yubico
can be added to this list of prominent companies that have successfully leveraged this aspect to
improve their competitive advantage.
Not only do communities benefit members in the sense that they belong somewhere, they can
also come with competitive benefits when they are based around a company. Below we have
listed some of the critical value drivers of having a community.
A sense of belonging to a community is often followed by a sense of loyalty and, in the best cases,
even advocacy. There are parallels here to many companies, but we consider Fortnox or Plejd to
be two of the best examples. At Fortnox, the accountants using the product work as natural
salespeople, recommending the Fortnox software to their clients, which raises customer
acquisition and retention rates. The same can be seen at Plejd, a relatively small Swedish provider
of smart lighting, where the electricians using the company’s product serve as ambassadors for
the product to their end-users. In both these cases, free word-of-mouth recommendations
increase sales and reduce costs, which together reduces customers acquisition costs (CAC).

A company that properly engages with its community can better understand the needs of its
clients. By consulting with the community regarding new features, flaws with current offerings
and feedback on new product lines, companies increase their odds of taking the right strategic
direction. In addition, a passionate community is often engaged in the company's offering and
can provide real-time insight into emerging trends and changing market demands. This is more
cost-efficient and arguably more accurate than hiring external consultants to conduct a market
survey. In addition, an army of enthusiastic users is likely to produce more innovative ideas than
any strategy consultant. An example of a company who have been particularly successful in this
regard is Valve through its Steam Workshop.

An active community can work as a free extension of a company’s customer support function.
By levering its experienced users, newcomers can often get a lot of help with onboarding,
troubleshooting and general tips. Community members also work as natural up-sellers through
the sharing of guidance, sharing best practices and highlighting success stories, providing
additional reason for a new customer to stick around and engage further. The creation of, e.g.,
tutorials and reviews on websites, YouTube and social media further drives traffic to the company
and their offerings. Microsoft, Snowflake and Apple are companies that have been highly
successful in this regard.

We are convinced that active company communities contribute to higher retention rates and
customer satisfaction. When customers feel appreciated and part of a larger community, they are
much more unlikely to switch to a competitive offering, naturally decreasing a company’s churn.
In addition, a strong community showcases for new customers that they are not just purchasing
a product or a service but that they also gain access to a supportive network of engaged users.
Lego is an example of a company that has successfully built up a supportive community for
sharing user-created content.

The above companies, which all have thriving communities, are highly successful. While we
acknowledge that a community alone cannot guarantee success, we firmly believe that when
utilised effectively, it confers a competitive advantage. Yubico has, for a long time, had a very
engaged customer base. As the company often emphasises, the sales journey often begins with
the acquisition of tech-savvy users or departments within organisations, who then become
advocates recommending YubiKeys to others. Yubico has established a firm position among
tech-savvy users, owing to the product’s impeccable security record with no documented
successful hacking attempts. These users often recommend the product and discuss diverse
features on online forums, like Reddit or Github, creating additional brand recognition and
supporting other less savvy users.

An active user base on multiple platforms

Source: Yubico Forum, Reddit, Github, Trustpilot, Carnegie Research

Yubico has a community forum called Yubico Forum, where users can interact with each other
and the company. The forum covers a great variety of subjects, such as the physical keys, the
Yubico software, and integrations with other applications. Yubico also uses the forum as an
announcement channel, ensuring that its active users are the first ones to get information
regarding new features, bug fixes or new software integrations and involving them in beta testing
of new products. Yubico also encourages users to post ideas for product improvements and
create their own community projects.
When scrolling through posts on Reddit, Github, the Yubico Forum, social media and review
sites such as Trustpilot or Google reviews, we are quite impressed by the community surrounding
this company. People love the products, and the forums are generally supportive, with qualitative
discussions peer-to-peer as well as between Yubico’s moderators and its customers. Undoubtedly,

this serves Yubico well and provides it with several of the competitive edges we covered in the
previous section; not least related to brand loyalty and advocacy of new customers, ultimately
improving the company's sales and margins and paving the way for continued success.

Market trends and growth drivers
The cybersecurity market can be confusing and even overwhelming at first glance, with many
different verticals and layers, and with companies that often tend to work across verticals.
However, we believe it is fairly easy to understand that there are strong structural tailwinds
supporting the growth of the cybersecurity market for years to come and below we have covered
some of the drivers we think are the most important for Yubico.
Digitalisation has been, and remains, a growth driver for most digital companies, and it is also a
driver of cybersecurity growth. The trend from analogue to digital and offline to online is
inevitable, but we believe the transition to cloud-systems is perhaps an even more vital piece of
the cybersecurity puzzle. These days, companies collect a lot of data from customers, such as
online behaviour, financial transactions, social media views and purchasing trends, to name a few.
In 2021, every minute close to 700,000 Instagram stories were shared and 2m swipes on Tinder
were made, according to Statista, and these numbers could well be higher today. This is just two
companies, and all of this activity translates into data that is stored in a manner that it is accessible
online around the world. In line with increased usage of mobile apps and platforms, mobile
network traffic is expected to grow rapidly over the coming five years as well. For instance,
Ericsson estimates that global monthly average smartphone use will grow from 19GB per person
in 2023, to 46GB at the end of 2028.

The increased amount of data created and stored combined with the fact that remote work as a
phenomenon has increased in recent years, requiring the ability to access data from anywhere,
has boosted the usage of cloud tools and cloud data storage. The ‘work from anywhere’ trend
could potentially also open for other vulnerabilities as employees potentially may use a malicious
internet connection unknowingly. All of this means that the attack surface for hackers has become
broader and there is more data to access, stored in more places – quite an appealing combination
for hackers, we would argue.

Cyber-attacks are improving and can with greater ease bypass traditional network firewall-based
security protocols, according to Yubico. There is also a larger use of advanced digital tools such
as artificial intelligence (AI), machine learning (ML) and automation, which can decrease the time
it takes to hack as well as make the attempts more effective, according to McKinsey. As an
example, McKinsey describes an AI and ML leveraged malware called Emotet, which targeted
banks with contextualised phishing emails that hijacked other email threats. In unison with
improving cyber threats is the increasing interest for the topic, as the cost of attacks has been
lowered substantially with capabilities such as ransomware as a service and cryptocurrency,
according to McKinsey.

Cyber warfare, often defined as a cyber-attack that targets a country in one way or another, might
sound like a fictional occurrence or something from the far future. But it has been around for
several years; some even believe it dates back more than 10 years. One example of early cyber
warfare was Stuxnet, a cyber-attack targeting Iranian nuclear centrifuges and, according to GRA
Quantum, it reportedly ruined almost 20% of the centrifuges. As far as we know, no one has
taken responsibility for the attack, but there has been speculation in the media that it might have
been a joint operation between the US and Israel. There are several examples of cyber warfare
since then, both targeting countries directly, such as the hacks on Ukrainian websites in 2022, or
indirectly, such as the Colonial Pipeline attack which halted the pipeline operation.
Given the rise in connectivity, where today many people even have home appliances, like freezers
and dishwashers, connected to the internet or use virtual assistants like Alexa that are always
paying attention in the home, we argue that there is an increasing risk of warfare taking place
through cyber-attacks. Some of the potential risks include accessing and leveraging sensitive
information, attacking power grids or other critical infrastructure, or even target payment systems
and banks to disrupt the everyday life of citizens.

As cybersecurity becomes a more vital part of society, regulators are increasing their requirements
and guidance within this area. This can have an effect through either tougher compliance
requirements which ‘force’ companies to take cybersecurity more seriously, or through orders
and regulations such as the White House ‘Executive Order on Improving the Nation’s
Cybersecurity’ which requires US Federal agencies to use phishing resistant MFA.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

We believe orders like this from the White House often require their suppliers to use the same
security level as well, thus reaching a broader base than only the federal agencies themselves.
According to Yubico, there is also an overall trend where multi-factor authentication is being
rolled out to the full workforce in companies and often even pushed towards contractors and
partners of the company.
Global market trends

Cloud shift has accelerated zero trust framework – increasing
requirements for strong authentication
Increasing sophisticated cyber threats – hackers are able to
bypass traditional network firewall-based security controls, regular
email, mobile text message spam and phishing filters
Increasing regulatory requirements drive adoption of IAM
tools, e.g., new White House executive order requires all US Federal
agencies to use phishing-resistant MFA
Increasing shift to advanced authentication in workforce –
rolled out to the full workforce, often including partners, contractors
and customers’ customers
Shifting login models towards user experience and
passwordless – companies are independently exploring new login
models
IT security is vital for long-term sustainable growth for
companies – e.g., UN sustainable development goal #9

Essentially what most of the above-mentioned growth drivers distil down to is that the incentives
and possibilities for cyber-attacks have increased over the past years, and so have the number of
attacks. Looking at phishing attacks for example, the encounter rates have increased quite
substantially during 2020–22, according to a study by Lookout. The same study showed that both
private and enterprise users fell for substantially many more mobile phishing links in 2022
compared to 2020.

Cyber-attacks can often lead to leaks of companies’ or customers’ private information. Financial
losses are only one negative outcome of data breaches, hackers can also access sensitive
information about customers’ financial or medical records, for example. Naturally, big
cybercrimes often happen to big enterprises such as Meta (historical beaches at both Facebook
and Whatsapp), Microsoft, Whisper and Quora. This can severely affect customers’ perception
of the company and the brand, which in turn can weigh on future financial performance as well.

It is not only the number of attacks that is important, but also the total cost of data breaches.
IBM studied 550 organisations that suffered data breaches in its Cost of a Data Breach Report
2022, and it found that it took on average 277 days, or roughly three quarters of a year, to identify
and contain a breach in 2022. This was a slight improvement compared to 2021 but it has been
fluctuating around 260–290 days since 2016. The breach lifecycle is important, as longer data
breaches tend to be associated with higher costs. According to the same report, the costliest data
breaches tend to be phishing breaches, which IBM estimates costs on average about USD5m per
breach; closely followed by business email compromises, which on average cost around USD4.9m
to resolve. As such, the benefits of using YubiKeys to prevent breaches such as phishing and
stolen credentials are clear from a cost standpoint.

An increasing number of cyber breaches and potentially also bigger losses per breach translate to
increasing costs of cybercrimes. The cost of cybercrime relates to things such as damage and
destruction of data, stolen money, lost productivity, theft of intellectual property, theft of
personal and financial data, and embezzlement, and is expected to surge in the coming years. The
total cost of cybercrime is expected to increase from USD8.44tn in 2022 to USD23.84tn in 2027,
according to Statista.

Trends such as the increasing number of cyber-attacks and rising cost of cybercrime ultimately
support the need for cyber security. Depending on how the market is sliced and diced, different
sources report different numbers for the total market size. Gartner estimates that the information
security end-user spend will reach USD188bn in 2023, up 11.3% Y/Y. The global cyber security
market is expected to grow at a CAGR(22–30e) of ~10%, according to Polaris Market Research,
which however estimates a bigger market in 2023 than Gartner. The growth rates we have
observed from different sources are mostly around 8–10% annually for the coming 5–10 years
for the full cyber security market, with some slight variations in size and growth rate depending
on if, e.g., consulting services within cyber security are included.

The cyber security market is broad and consists of numerous verticals, all with different
characteristics and growth rates. Cloud security and application security were the two fastest
growing verticals in 2022 and 2023 while the slowest growing vertical was security services,
according to Gartner. Yubico operates withing the Identity and Access Management (IAM)
vertical, which grew by ~14–15% Y/Y in 2022–23.

Market data from IDC (presented by Yubico) shows that the entire IAM market is worth roughly
USD19bn, a tad lower than the Gartner data (~USD21bn). IAM contains a set of subsegments,
of which Yubico’s core segment is ‘Advanced authentication’, according to the company.
Advanced authentication is estimated to be worth USD4.5bn in 2023e and is the second largest
segment of IAM after ‘Identity management’, according to IDC.
IDC expects the global advanced authentication market to grow at a CAGR(21–27e) of ~13.6%
and reach a market size of USD7.2bn in 2027e. Thus, it is expected to outgrow the overall cyber
security market, based on the market data previously presented. We believe the higher expected
growth rate for the advanced authentication market can partly be explained by the fact that 95%
of cyber security breaches are caused by human error (e.g., falling for phishing scams,
downloading illicit software or managing a digital identity unsafely and the using same weak
password across platforms), according to the World Economic Forum, as well as by the fact that
nearly 40% of breaches in 2021 featured phishing (only 11% involved malware and 22% involved
hacking), according to Verizon. These are among the attack vectors that Yubico’s products have
been successful in stopping, bearing in mind that there have been zero known takeovers of
YubiKey accounts, according to the company.

Cyber-attacks and what they are
A cyber-attack, as defined by Yubico, is an online attack targeting an enterprise or individual for
the purpose of disrupting, disabling, destroying, or maliciously controlling their computing
infrastructure; destroying the integrity of their data; or stealing controlled information.
A cyber-attack is a malicious assault cybercriminals launch against a single or multiple computers
or networks using one or more computers. A cyber-attack can steal data, disable computers, or
launch other attacks from a breached computer. Cybercriminals use a range of techniques to
deploy cyber-attacks, among them denial of service, phishing, malware, and ransomware.
Cybersecurity firms exist to attempt to prevent cyber-attacks and protect clients from their
effects.

Types of cyber-attacks

These attacks can have many different forms and drivers behind them – some actors want to
influence, some want money, some want power, some may be working on behalf of a rogue state,
and some actors simply do it for fun. In this section, we will categorise various types of attacks,
the economics of hacking, and its rationale. In describing the different types of cyber-attacks, we
have gathered information from Crowdstrike, Cloudflare, Zscaler, Aura, Yubico and Fortinet.
For consistency, we have only used graphics from Cloudflare. We will look at:
• Malware-based attacks
• Phishing
• Man-in-the-middle/on-path
• Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service (DOS and DDoS)
• SQL injection attacks
For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

• DNS tunnelling
• Zero-day exploits
• Password attacks
• Supply chain attacks
• Rootkits
• Cross-site scripting
• IoT attacks
• Cryptojacking
Malware-based attacks
Malware refers to malicious software, and it is a software type that is created to disrupt, steal or
alter the data from a computer, network or a server. A hacker tricks the user into installing
malware on a device (often through a seemingly harmless link), and once installed, the software
runs scripts in the background to bypass security. The program can give hackers access to
sensitive data, send and transmit data, and can take control of the device. According to security
company Aura, malware is the most commonly used cyber-attack. Malware is an overall category,
which comes in many variations:

74

18 September 2023

c

Yubico

• Ransomware: This malware type encrypts files on a system and blocks access until a ransom
is paid. Another similar variation is an extortion attack, where a hacker has accessed
confidential information, such as personal documents and pictures, and where the hacker
demands payment, or else the information will be published online. Ransomware has
increased in popularity after the boom in cryptocurrency. Adversaries can demand payment
in cryptocurrencies, and receive payments, without any traceability.
• Spyware: This software observes what you do on your devices – it tracks your activities, sites
you visit, your behaviour, and it can take note of bank details, passwords and logins and send
this back to the hacker
• Keylogger: A keylogger is similar to spyware but behaves a little differently. This software
tracks every keystroke made and sends the data in text format back to the hacker. An obvious
use case here is password theft. There are also physical versions of keyloggers that can be
inserted into a computer via an USB drive, for example
• Trojans: A trojan is a program that hides inside legitimate software – this could be anything
from a game to Microsoft Office or even an antivirus program. The program hides within the
real software and gets installed during the general installation process. It is common to place
trojans in software downloaded from filesharing networks, or through unofficial sites.
• Virus: A virus is a malware type that attaches itself to another program, such as a document.
It can then replicate and spread after having been used, and spread to more programs and
devices. A computer virus is similar to other malware, but it requires a host program, and it
requires user action to transmit from one system to another. A computer eventually shows
symptoms, such as frequent crashes of programs, slow compute performance, loss of data
from the hard drive, mass emails sent out from your account. Viruses could be made into an
entire subcategory, much like we wrote here on malware.

Phishing
A phishing attack is when you receive a fraudulent email, but where the email looks like someone
you know, or purports to represent a person or a business that you know – such as a company
representative from e.g. your IT vendor or your bank. These can occur on text messages to the
phone (smishing) and through phone calls (vishing). Phishing emails often include instructions
to share account information and passwords, or include links to click, where you end up on a site
where your information could be stolen. There are several types of phishing attack:
• Wide attacks: These attacks do not target specific individuals, but instead are mass emails,
with the hope of reaching someone that would share the desired information.
• Spear phishing: This attack is sent to a specific individual. It is an attack that is harder to scale,
i.e. send widely, as it often uses personal data that may have been acquired through, for
example, keylogging, and use that information to make the approach sound believable and
real
• Whaling: Whaling is in essence a spear attack, but on a high-profile individual, or managers at
a company. It can be done either to scam the person individually, or to get them to access the
network of the company they represent. According to Aura, CEO fraud is a market worth
over USD25bn annually.
• Angler phishing: Angler phishing occurs mainly on social media, where imposters pretend to
be representatives from well-known companies, such as Netflix. An account name could for
example be @Nëtflix rather than @Netflix, and the aim is to steal information.

Man-in-the-middle/on-path
A Man-in-the-middle attack is when a hacker intercepts a network connection. This is most
common on public Wi-Fi networks, that have many people accessing them, and which are easily
hacked. This process is done to steal data, and to steal personal information and logins. This
attack type exploits a vulnerability in WPA2 (Wi-Fi Protected Access II). WPA2 is a security
protocol that protects pretty much all Wi-Fi networks. It uses strong encryption to protect
communication between a user’s device and the Wi-Fi device. This encryption standard is meant
to stop anyone that might intercept the communication – data could be retrieved, but it would
not be decipherable. WPA2 connections are initiated through several sequences, but if the
connection is lost, the entire sequence is not required for a reconnection. This is done to enable
faster reconnections when network downtime occurs. A hacker makes a clone of a Wi-Fi network
– same name, password, frequency, etc. So when a device, for example, disconnects from a
network the user is familiar with, and then reconnects, the hacker forces the device to connect to
the cloned network instead. The user may not notice any difference, since the cloned network
has internet access. Once the encryption has been compromised, the hacker can capture the data
that is transmitted over the Wi-Fi network.
There are websites and applications that encrypt information in devices, but the hacker may use
features such as SSLstrip to circumvent encryption, forcing the user to use HTTP versions of
websites, rather than using SSL encrypted versions of websites. This can easily be done as an
admin of a network. Imagine your own workplace – your employer may have blocked certain
websites because they are associated with e.g. gambling. The hacker may have blocked
https://twitter.com – the SSL encrypted version of Twitter, and instead the route targets to
http://twitter.com, which is the unencrypted version. In this environment, the hacker can
intercept the information.

Denial of Service and Distributed Denial of Service (DOS and DDoS)
DOS and DDoS attacks do not steal data, but instead overwhelm servers, forcing services to shut
down. A DOS attack is when a hacker uses a program to flood a server with ‘fake’ traffic. The
request is made to appear to come from legitimate users. The ‘service’ that is offered is thus
‘denied’ due to the request flooding, leading to a loss of bandwidth and network resources.
Legitimate users thus cannot access the site.
A DOS or a DDoS attack is like an unexpected traffic jam clogging a road, preventing regular
traffic from reaching their destination. Think of a website that can host 15,000 active browsers
simultaneously, then 25,000 passive browsers (that have rendered a page for example, then they
spend some time there, they click further, causing another rendering, and so on).

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

A DOS attack to the website could send, for example, 20,000 requests every second, effectively
shutting the site down, because it cannot handle the number of requests. DOS attacks can be
used for extortion – while there is no customer data lost, instead, the service is lost, and this can
result in the loss of revenue or cause reputational harm. Depending on how a service or site is
hosted, a DOS attack could bring it down completely. A DDoS attack is the same as a DOS
attack, but it is done from multiple sources, compared to DOS attacks, which is one source. It is
easier to overwhelm a target with a DDoS attack than a DOS attack.
A hacker can leverage several devices, often a group of compromised computers referred to as
botnets, which operate in a synchronised manner – they await instructions from an attacker and
flood a single IP address. Internet devices can be hijacked and used for DDoS attacks without
their owners knowing it, and users may even offer their devices output for DDoS attacks, in
exchange for money. DOS and DDoS attacks can be used even against the most robust security
systems – Amazon, Google and GitHub have all been victims of DDoS attacks.

SQL injection attacks
Websites typically use SQL databases where they store information such as accounts and
passwords. An SQL injection, one of the most common hacking techniques, is when a hacker
attempts to trick the database into giving up this information. Hackers use various techniques to
access the sensitive data. They can use different SQL commands to generate errors from the
database server – for example, they can try to login by typing a random account number and a
random password, to see how the database responds.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

The database responds with an error message, such as “enter a valid email address”, to get an
understanding of the database structure. They try different things, looking at error messages, try
console commands, and website elements, to find vulnerabilities in the database.
This is often combined with union-based SQL injection, where the hacker tries multiple
commands, and not targeting the error messages, such as altering the URL, sending commands
that return HTTP responses and so on, again to get an understanding of the architecture. Then
the hackers learn about the hosting server by sending data payloads to it and looking at how it
responds. They send different types, with different sizes, in different time frames and frequencies,
to determine responses, and infer results based on responses.

DNS tunnelling
This is an attack where hackers try to bypass traditional security systems such as firewalls to get
access to systems and networks. Hackers add malicious programs in DNS (Domain Name
System) queries to try to get access. DigitalOcean explains DNS queries in the following way: “A
DNS query is a request for information from a DNS server. For example, each time you enter a
domain name into your browser, such as example.com, your browser makes a DNS query to
locate the IP address for that domain name”.
Cloudflare calls DNS the “phonebook of the internet”. Returning to the DigitalOcean example
– when you type in an address into your browser, DNS is responsible for finding the correct IP
address to those sites. Then the browser uses these addresses to communicate with origin servers,
to access website information. Like SQL injection, DNS tunnelling uses various protocols to
tunnel through DNS queries, but then pass malware onto the targeted server. From there, it can
direct traffic that is intended for a specific domain, elsewhere – the hacker can direct it where he
or she desires. The goal is often to direct the traffic to a replica of the original site, and from there
collect login information.

Zero-day exploits
Well known computer scientist Lex Friedman invited Nicole Perlroth, an expert in cybersecurity
and digital espionage, onto his podcast, where they had an over two-hour long discussion of
various types of cybercrimes. Ms Perlroth said that zero-day exploits are the most serious cyberattacks. A zero-day exploit is an unknown vulnerability that is part of software code or a network
from launch, without the manufacturer being aware of it from. In this episode, Apple was
discussed as an example – it might release a new version of their operating system, but it might
contain a way for adversaries to access iCloud data. In the term, zero refers to the number of
days past since the vulnerability was discovered – making ‘day-zero’ the first day measures are
taken to fix it. Microsoft, Google and Apple have all had to patch zero-day vulnerabilities. Unless
contained, the damage could be critical. In the podcast, Ms Perlroth says how exploits can be
discovered and not divulged, then traded for money – and rogue states are most often the highest
bidders. Zero-day exploits, before they are uncovered, can be worth a significant amount of
money. Log4J had a zero-day vulnerability, which was described by CISA director Jen Esaterly as
“the most serious vulnerability of my career”, because it is used across the entire internet. Zeroday vulnerabilities are applicable to any businesses.

Password attacks
Password attacks are often less sophisticated compared to the other attacks discussed in this
section. They are done either through ‘spraying’, which is to try the same password on many
accounts, on many sites. Aura says that over 3.5m Americans use the password ‘123456’.
Hackers can also use brute force attacks, which is when you know the account number, but guess
the password. The software tries to different passwords, until it finds a combination that works.
This may seem like an impossible task, but there is software that could theoretically, if the website
allows that many requests, attempt am combinations per minute.
Brute force hackers can purchase logins on various sites, which they then use the combination
software on.
There are some more sophisticated versions of this attack. Hackers can create a site that appears
fully legitimate – it could be a football fan site, or a video game forum. The intent of the site is
to get users to create accounts, and from there build a database of account names and passwords,
as people often use the same combinations on many sites, which the hackers then use to access
other information.
Supply chain attacks
Every internet service utilises third-party tools, which can be attacked. Supply chain attack refers
to the concept of hackers wanting to hack site A, but doing so by going after site B or service C,
which are services that site A has some dependency on, sometimes unknowingly. Cloudflare
explains dependencies in the following way: “A dependency is a program or piece of code (often
written in JavaScript) from third-party providers that enhances application functionality. A
dependency used by an ecommerce retailer, for instance, might help run customer assistance
chatbots or capture information about site visitor activity. Hundreds, if not thousands, of these
dependencies can be found in a broad range of software, applications, and services that targets
use to maintain their applications and networks.”

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

To carry out such an attack, hackers need access to the third-party system or tool that they want
to exploit. This is often done by stealing credentials and gaining temporary access to systems
needed to perform such an attack.
There are many ways to make a supply chain attack: browser-based, software, open source,
javascript, Magecart, watering hole and cryptojacking are some of them. Supply chain attacks are
sometimes referred to as Magecart attacks.

Rootkits
A rootkit attack is when a hacker attempts to get operation system access. A compromised rootkit
is a critical issue. This is software that runs when the operating system boots and can basically be
seen as gaining administrative process rights of a computer. When there has been a rootkit
compromise, a hacker can install more malware on the system, hidden from the user. There is a
famous rootkit scandal from Sony, which sold more than 20m music CDs which came with an
infected rootkit that would install itself on a computer once it was inserted. In 2022, Kaspersky
uncovered rootkits that were still on victims’ machines even after total reinstallations.

Cross-site scripting
Cross-site scripting (XSS) is when hackers exploit vulnerabilities when websites are loaded. There
are several ways to insert harmful code, but the most common is to do this through email or by
adding it at the end of a URL that displays user-generated content. The attack typically targets
the client-side code, which is run on the user’s machine. The opposite is server-side code, which
is executed at the host. This is a tricky attack, as it can be executed on legitimate sites. Modern
websites execute cross-site code, which is to utilise both client-side and server-side codes.
YouTube, Facebook and Twitter are site examples that have been used for XSS. Client-side code
is necessary for websites that have interactive content, such as video games or streaming sites.
The point of the attack is to run malicious code on the client side, even if it is a legitimate site.
Vulnerabilities can be handled, but this is tricky, as the hacker utilises several factors of
vulnerabilities.

IoT attacks
Speakers, TVs, gaming consoles, media players and even toys can be targets for cyber-attacks.
These devices typically do not have any built-in software security and, from that perspective, are
easy targets. Hackers can overcome various account details through such attacks, but it is also
common to include IoT devices in a botnet to carry out DDoS attacks, which we covered earlier
in this section.

Cryptojacking
This attack uses your computer’s processing power to mine cryptocurrencies, such as bitcoins.
The computer may behave similarly as when infected with a virus – it becomes slow and
unresponsive. Hackers thus take over the processing power and deploy it elsewhere.

Cybersecurity frameworks
Having described the most common cyber-attacks, we will now move on to the services
and solutions used to protect and prevent such attacks. Cybersecurity is a complex and
dynamic market with many companies, technologies and buzzwords. In this section we
take a closer look at two cybersecurity frameworks that were introduced in the US in
2013–14 and which we think provide a good introduction and overview of how companies
and organisations are managing cyber threats. These frameworks suggest to us that
Yubico’s solutions have a very relevant role in protecting against cyber-attacks – one that
will be difficult to replace through other tools and solutions.

The NIST cybersecurity framework

The NIST Cybersecurity Framework is a set of guidelines, best practices, and standards designed
to help organisations manage and improve their cybersecurity risk management processes. It was
developed by National Institute of Standards and Technology, a US federal agency within the
Department of Commerce, to provide a flexible and adaptable framework that can be applied to
various industries and organisations. The framework was first released in 2014 in response to a
presidential executive order aimed at improving cybersecurity relating to critical infrastructure in
the US. Gartner estimates that in 2021, 50% of US organisations were using the framework. We
think it provides a good overview of key cybersecurity methods and processes. It also reveals
how different software solutions and cybersecurity companies are related and positioned in the
market.
The framework is structured around five core functions. We can see that the first three are
dominated by technology and software solutions to manage and mitigate cyber threats, while the
other two – Respond and Recover – are typically more focused on personnel-dependent
processes and plans.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

• Identify: This function involves understanding the organisation’s cybersecurity risks by
identifying and documenting the assets, systems, data, and capabilities that are essential for
business operations. It includes activities such as asset management, risk assessment, and
establishing a baseline for cybersecurity requirements.
• Protect: The protect function focuses on implementing safeguards to reduce the risk of cyberattacks. This includes activities like access control, protection of devices and sensitive data,
and managing device vulnerability.
• Detect: This function involves the capability to identify cybersecurity events promptly. It
includes activities such as continuous monitoring, anomaly detection, and incident response
planning to quickly detect and respond to potential security incidents.
• Respond: The respond function outlines the actions to be taken in response to a detected
cybersecurity incident. It includes incident response planning, communication strategies, and
coordination with external stakeholders such as law enforcement and incident response
teams.
• Recover: The recover function focuses on restoring normal operations after a cybersecurity
incident and minimising the impact. This includes activities like system backups, recovery
planning, and conducting lessons learned discussions to improve future incident responses.
The framework is a risk-based approach, allowing organisations to assess their current
cybersecurity posture, set goals, and prioritise investments and activities based on their unique
risk profile. It emphasises the need for continuous monitoring, assessment, and improvement of
cybersecurity practices.
The framework is not prescriptive, meaning it does not mandate specific technologies or
solutions. Instead, it provides a flexible structure and a common language for organisations to

Multi-factor authentication (MFA) plays an important role in the NIST Cybersecurity Framework
by serving as a recommended security control for ensuring secure access to systems and data.
MFA is relevant in the first two core functions of the framework. It is explicitly mentioned as a

The US President’s executive order in May 2021 is a comprehensive directive to address the risk
of cyber-attacks in the US. NIST was mandated to develop a plan to implement an IT security
architecture based on the concept of Zero Trust among US authorities and government bodies.
Zero Trust refers to a new set of concepts permeating modern cyber security, built on the idea
that ‘no one can be trusted – verify everyone and everything’. In essence, it is a set of rules
informing the design of security programs so that no user or agent have implicit trust. Rather,
every device seeking access to any corporate network, asset or system must be both authorised

and authenticated. This would require increasing efforts to develop new standards, tools, and best
practices to enhance software supply chain security. The guidelines are aimed at federal agencies
but are also available for industry and others to use. The executive order and NIST’s updated
guidelines resulted in an increased focus on multi-factor authentication which is required by all
federal authorities. We think this is strong support for Yubico’s solutions and position in the
market. NIST, for example, had a picture of a YubiKey in a presentation called ‘Multi-factor
authentication and SP 800-63 digital identity guidelines’ on 15 February 2022.

The MITRE ATT&CK framework

The MITRE ATT&CK framework (Adversarial Tactics, Techniques, and Common Knowledge),
is a comprehensive knowledge base of cyber threat tactics and the techniques that are used by
attackers during various stages of a cyber-attack. It was developed by MITRE Corporation, a
non-profit organisation that operates federally funded research and development centres.
ATT&CK provides a structured and standardised way to describe and categorise cyber threat
activities, helping organisations understand and analyse the techniques employed by adversaries.
It is widely used by cybersecurity professionals, threat intelligence teams, and incident responders
to enhance their understanding of threats, improve detection and prevention capabilities, and
enhance the overall security posture of an organisation. According to ESG research, 48% of
organisations say they use the MITRE ATT&CK framework “extensively” for security operations
while another 41% use it on a limited basis.
The first ATT&CK model was created in September 2013 and was primarily focused on the
Windows enterprise environment. MITRE further refined the framework and in May 2015
publicly released an upgraded version with 96 techniques organised under nine tactics. The
original ATT&CK was expanded in 2017 beyond Windows to include Mac and Linux and has
been referred to as ATT&CK for Enterprise.

We think that the MITRE ATT&CK framework can be a useful tool in competitive analysis by
providing insights into the capabilities and effectiveness of various cybersecurity solutions. The
framework can help assess the capabilities of cybersecurity products offered by different
companies. By understanding the tactics and techniques that adversaries employ, a company can
evaluate how well a particular product aligns with the identified threats.

Yubico

The framework can for example highlight the role of Yubico’s multi-factor authentication
solutions in the cybersecurity landscape. We can see that there are several areas in the framework
that support the value of MFA.
The framework shows that MFA can help prevent or impede attackers from gaining initial access
to systems or applications through techniques like credential stuffing, brute-forcing, or password
spraying. It also highlights that MFA helps protect against techniques like stolen credentials or
account hijacking. Even if an attacker obtains a username and password, they would need the
additional factors to successfully authenticate.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

In the framework’s Persistence techniques tactic section, MFA can reduce the risk of persistent
unauthorised access, as the attacker would need additional factors beyond compromised
credentials to maintain their presence. MFA is also a highly relevant defence in MITRE
ATT&CK’s so called Defense Evasion and Discovery, Lateral Movement tactics. The framework
shows that MFA is an effective security control that can significantly reduce the success rate of
many attacks and make it harder for adversaries to compromise systems or gain unauthorised
access.

Endpoint and network security
Endpoint security and network security are two essential components of a comprehensive
cybersecurity strategy, and they focus on protecting different aspects of an organisation's IT
infrastructure.
Endpoint security refers to the protection of endpoints, such as desktops, laptops, servers, mobile
devices, and other network-connected devices, from various cybersecurity threats. Endpoints are
often the entry point for cyber-attacks, making them a critical focus area for security measures.
Endpoint security aims to secure these devices, prevent unauthorised access, detect and block
malware and other potential risks. Endpoint security solutions typically include a combination of
software and hardware components that work together to protect endpoints from threats.
Network security focuses on securing an organisation’s network infrastructure, including routers,
switches, firewalls, and other network devices. It aims to protect the network itself, the data
transmitted across it, and the connections between different network components. The primary
goals of network security are to prevent unauthorised access to the network, detect and block
malicious network traffic, secure data in transit, and mitigate risks associated with network
infrastructure.
We will also have a section on identity access management, as this is also a crucial product set for
enabling fully fledged protection, although the addressable market in monetary terms is larger in
the first two categories. This could be extended into more categories: monitoring, cloud security
(or cloud workload security) and vulnerability management.

What an antivirus program is, how it works, and why it is largely obsolete today
So far, we have in this report described some of the most common types of cyber-attacks, how
they work and how they can be used against you. We think that most people are familiar with
what antivirus software is – most of us have at some point encountered it. This type of software,
and this sector, has had a diametrical shift in the past 10 years – we protect our devices and our
internet security in a different way today. While antivirus software is still around, we think it is
right to regard it as a legacy form of protection against cyber-attacks. We think that the cyber
security space is quite complex, and to understand it, we think it makes sense to dissect how
antivirus software works, and why there has been such a massive shift in market share in favour
of next-generation security vendors compared to legacy security.
What is antivirus software?
Antivirus software is designed to combat computer viruses. It searches for viruses, and when and
if it detects one, it attempts to remove the virus. Typically, the software scans your computer files
once it has been installed, and then continuously scans your device for any new files that are
created, and then also routinely makes a re-scan of all computer files.
Below we show, conceptually, how antivirus software works. In principle, antivirus (AV) software
can be seen as having a ledger of various code strings. It is gatekeeping your computer, and if a
file is about to be saved, the AV will first check it by consulting the ledger. If the file has the same
code string as a file on its ledger, it will be deleted. File number five is corrupt and successfully
identified and access is restricted – it matches the registry of a file that is malicious. In the example
below, we have marked a file yellow, which is supposed to represent a malicious file, but one that
is not in the ledger or registry and, since the AV does not recognise it, this file is granted access.

AV could also miss a file that appears to be legitimate, but has a specific trigger, that is malicious.
The drawback of an AV is that it refers to a mostly static database, looking for these registries, or
rather, signatures. The database is not always static, it does get updated, but for the most part, it
is static. In practice, if a hacker creates a new virus, the AV will not detect it, meaning it is not
that dynamic. There has been rapid growth in data consumption in the last decade, which exposes
another weakness of the traditional antiviruses: the operating model itself. Performing scans and
running file registries versus a database drains hardware (and network) performance. In fact,
running an AV slows performance drastically, while offering inconclusive protection.

Next-generation antivirus (NGAV)

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

As the name suggests, NGAV is the AV for the new world – more files, higher data consumption,
more device connectivity. They differ principally in how they work: the AV is static slow, is
signature based, and is inconclusive, whereas NGAV offers much more protection. Where the
AV is based on scanning the endpoint, the NGAV offers many more features, but with lesser
impact on the endpoint performance. An NGAV learns the behaviour of the endpoint and
identifies inconsistent behaviour, rather than run signatures.
This approach makes NGAV more conclusive in protecting the endpoint – it offers protection
against all type of malware, rather than only those that are known. An NGAV uses a combination
of AI, behavioural detection, machine learning and exploit mitigation to create a secure
environment, meaning that it can respond to unknown threats as well. According to Crowdstrike,
over 60% of all cyber-attacks in 2021 were fileless, something which an AV has no response to,
whereas an NGAV does. A fileless attack uses things like macros, scripts, or in-memory execution
to run malicious code, compared to the reactive mode of an antivirus.

An analogy with our other coverage – Truecaller

Another company in our coverage – Truecaller – is a good way, we think, to illustrate the
differences between AV and NGAV. Spam and scam phone calls are a big issue today, and
operators have been unable to stop their growth. Operators and their spam protection in their
networks work in the same way as an AV. They know and are aware of a set of numbers which
are categorised as spammers, which they put into a database. Whenever this number now makes
a call to one of the operator’s customers, it is blocked. But calls from any new number spammers
use will be put through.

Operator scam and spam detection

Source: Carnegie Research

Modern spam calls are far more sophisticated – we would categorise operators’ protection as
extremely limited. A modern hacker does not take his or her phone and start dialling random
numbers to scam. The modern hacker or scammer utilises the cloud, which can be used to scale
legal and illegal activities. Scammers can create temporary numbers, virtual numbers, and even
spoof existing numbers and then make spam calls with significant scale. In 2021, Truecaller
identified a number that had made 202m calls. One single number. This number was blocked by
Truecaller in a matter of minutes, but still not identified by the operator. We think that this is a
good example of illustrating how an AV works, and its limitations.

Operator scam and spam detection

Source: Carnegie Research

We think that Truecaller’s spam protection is similar to that of an NGAV, as we have illustrated
below. Truecaller has a database of scam and spam numbers, similar to the technology that an
operator uses, but to only rely on this is too static – new numbers, or unknown numbers are not
covered, which is where scam and spam really comes from. Truecaller is a crowdsourced network,
with over 300m active users globally.

18 September 2023

89

Yubico

Imagine a new number is created with the purpose of spamming and starts calling Truecaller
users frequently. Truecaller will notice that there is a new number, that is targeting its users. The
users may also report the number as a spammer. Truecaller now restricts the number from its
network, whereas the operator is still clueless. We think that this analogy is accurate when
comparing an AV with an NGAV.
Where the AV is static, slow and signature based, as described earlier, the NGAV is not only
lightweight, but it also considers the behaviour of malware. If it detects something suspicious, it
observes it, and, like Truecaller, it can restrict it from other endpoints using the same NGAV,
across enterprises. As such, an NGAV is superior to an AV, but in modern cybersecurity
protection using only an NGAV is not enough.

Endpoint Protection Platform (EPP)

While the NGAV is the modern standard of AV, it seldom comes alone. Crowdstrike, a leading
cloud security vendor, seldom sells only an NGAV. Instead, it sells an Endpoint Protection
Platform (EPP).
Below we have attempted to illustrate the evolution of endpoint protection. With its origisn in
the AV and NGAV discussed above, the next levels of the evolution curve were Endpoint
Detection and Response (EDR) systems, and then Extended Detection and Response (XDR)
systems. These are extensions of the EPP – so if one understands the concept of EPPs, we think
it is easy to understand their upgrades as well. The leading EDR players on the market are
Crowdstrike, Microsoft, Trend Micro, SentinelOne Palo Alto, Elastic and VMware Carbon Black,
according to Gartner and Forrester.

As the name suggests, an EPP is a platform that handles security for an enterprise. It is a suite of
endpoint security technologies that work together to prevent, detect and remediate security
threats. We have included an image below of the Crowdstrike EPP. The image below should be
read from the bottom and then up. At the bottom are the endpoints that are used in enterprises
– computers and laptops, servers, mobile devices that the staff uses, IOT devices (printers,
fridges, coffee machines etc.), cloud applications and so on. The endpoints are all equipped with
a lightweight agent, basically a program, that tracks various activities that occur on the endpoint
– web browsing, network connections, file downloads and so on.

Like a CRM system, an EPP platform has many different modules, the grey boxes at the top of
the image, which are used to build comprehensive protection. The red boxes are categories. An
EPP typically offers device-, network and browser protection, application controls and data
controls. These are typically gained by acquiring an NGAV, firewalls, threat monitoring, malware
search and analysis, log management and so on. EDR is basically a ‘version’ of the EPP, which
focuses on the endpoints. The EDR becomes and XDR when more capacity is added. The EDR
is siloed towards the endpoints and the XDR unifies siloed data and tools across all sources – be
it the endpoints, the network, third party applications and so on.

Network security

In the following section, we will discuss network security, and we will mainly put our focus on
firewalls, and next generation firewalls, which are among the key components in cybersecurity.
The section could be expanded further by discussing hardware, remote access, segmentation and
remote access, and zero trust networking.
The evolution of network security has been driven by the changing threat landscape,
advancements in technology, and the increasing complexity of networks. Over time, network
security has evolved from basic perimeter defences to a more comprehensive and layered
approach that addresses a wide range of threats.

Firewalls

Most people who use computers have at least heard of firewalls as well as AV software. The
concept of firewalls has been around for as long as the internet has been around. A firewall has
always been one of the cornerstones in internet security. A firewall is a system that monitors and
controls network traffic, and it is based on different security rules. The aim of the firewall is to
filter traffic and protect a network from bad traffic, basically blocking it. It is a barrier that sits
between the private network and the public internet. The barrier allows ‘good’ traffic in, and
blocks bad, as the illustration shows.

Firewalls explained by Cloudflare

Source: Carnegie Research, Cloudflare

According to Check Point, a cybersecurity software company, there are different types of
firewalls:
• Packet filtering: The firewall analyses a small amount of data and distributes it according to
the firewall/filter standards.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

• Proxy Service: A network security system that protects connections while also filtering at the
application layer. These are proxy based, which means that there is a computer that acts as a
gateway between the local network, and the internet. Cloudflare describes proxy-based
firewalls as “like a bouncer at a bar. This bouncer stops guests before they enter the bar to
make sure they are not underage, armed, or in any other way a threat to the bar and its patrons.
The bouncer also stops patrons on their way out to ensure that they have a safe way to get
home and are not planning to drink and drive.”
• Stateful inspection: A stateful application is one that saves data from previous events and
interactions. A stateful firewall works in the same way, as it saves information of the
connections it has and uses information to analyse incoming and outgoing traffic, instead of
inspecting every packet, as the proxy service firewall does. This makes them much faster than
the proxy-based ones. These firewalls rely on context when making decisions. If it records
one kind of connection that responds with the firewall in a specific way, it will block this
connection type if it interacts with the firewall in a different way (i.e. perhaps an anomaly).
These firewalls have known vulnerabilities: they can be tricked. A client can request a certain
kind of information, and then an attacker can send malicious packets that match the firewall
criteria.

Next generation firewall (NGFW)

As it says in the name, NGFWs are also a firewall, but we would put them in a separate category
as it is broader than the others. NGFWs are also the ‘future’ of firewalls, and a crucial component
of modern internet security. Before going into the details of NGFWs, we will briefly explain the
open systems interconnection (OSI) model, as we argue that a basic understanding of the model
will make it easier to understand the advantages NGFWs hold over other firewalls.
This model was created by the International Organization for Standardization, and it enables
communication systems to communicate using standard protocols. A network protocol is a
standardised set of rules for formatting and processing data that enables systems to communicate
with each other. What OSI basically provides is a standard for computer systems to speak to each
other, and the model is seen as a universal language for computer networking in seven layers,
18 September 2023

93

c

Yubico

with each layer stacked upon the last. Each layer handles a specific task and communicates with
the layers above and below it. As we noted above, we believe a basic comprehension of the OSI
model can help to understand of the capabilities of an NGFW. For instance, whereas a traditional
firewall processes traffic at the third and fourth layer of the model, a NGFW can process traffic
also at the seventh and highest layer. The application layer has become the most important layer
to analyse as it is increasingly used for attacks, and because traditional firewalls can easily be
bypassed.
Earlier in this report, we described various cyber-attacks – one could also divide these attacks
into the seven layers below: an API attack targets layer seven, protocol attacks target layer three
and four and DDoS attacks can target several layers.

The open systems interconnection (OSI) model explained by Cloudflare

Source: Carnegie Research, Cloudflare

Physical layer
The first layer is the physical layer, which includes physical equipment involved in the transfer of
data, such as cables and switches.
Data link and network layer
Layers 2 and 3 are similar to each other. The network layer (3) facilitates the transfer of data
between two networks. If two devices are on the same network and communicate with each
other, a network layer is not needed. The network layer breaks up segments from the transport
layer (4) into smaller parts, called packets on the sender’s device, and then reassembles these on
the receiving device. This layer also finds the best path for data to reach its destination – this is
also called routing. The data link layer is similar to the network layer but facilitates data transfer
between devices on the same network.
Transport layer
The transport layer is responsible for end-to-end communication between devices. The transport
layer takes data from the session layer (5) and breaks it up into pieces called segments, and then
sends it to layer 3. The transport layer on the receiving device reassembles the segments into data
that the session layer can consume. The transport layer also handles flow and error control. Flow
means finding the optimal speed of transmission and ensures that a sender with fast connection
does drown a receiver with slow connection (why send traffic at 200mb/s when the limit is 100?).
Error control means ensuring that the data received is complete and requesting retransmission if
it is not.
94

Yubico

Session layer
The time between when the communication between two devices is opened and then closed is
called a session. The session layer makes sure that the session is open long enough for all data to
be exchanged, but then closed as soon as possible to not waste performance. This layer also syncs
data with checkpoints. For example, if a user is downloading a file of 1GB, the session layer
makes a ‘checkpoint’ every 10MB of transfer, so that if the connection is interrupted it can be
resumed from the checkpoint. Without this feature, the download would have to be started from
the beginning.
Presentation layer
The presentation layer prepares data so that the application layer can use it. It makes data
presentable for applications, and it is responsible for translation, encryption and compression of
data. Devices may be communicating, but may be using different encoding methods, and the
presentation layers translates such incoming data so that a receiving device can understand it.
Application layer
Software, like a web browser, relies on the application layer to be able to initiate communications.
This layer is the only one that directly interacts with data from the user. Software applications are
not part of the application layer, they just need it to be able to present data to the user.
NGFW
NGFWs build on what traditional firewalls offer. They do what the traditional firewalls do, but
more efficiently, with higher security and with more features.
Cloudflare explains NGFWs as follows: “Consider two airport security agencies. One checks to
make sure passengers are not on any no-fly lists, that their identities match what is listed on their
tickets, and that they are going to destinations the airport serves. The second one, in addition to
checking no-fly lists and so on, inspects what the passengers are carrying, making sure they do
not have dangerous or disallowed items. The first agency keeps airports secure from obvious
threats; the second also identifies threats that may be less obvious.”
For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

An ordinary firewall is like the first security agency: it blocks or allows data (passengers) based on
where it is going, whether it is part of a legitimate network connection, and where it comes from.
An NGFW is more like the second security agency: it inspects data on a deeper level to identify
and block threats that may be hidden in normal-seeming traffic.
Traditional firewalls have some protection, but they have several vulnerabilities and may let
malicious packets onto an endpoint simply because it cannot detect them. An NGFW addresses
this. As per the definition of a NGFW according to Gartner, it should be capable of:
• Application awareness and control
• Intrusion prevention
• Threat intelligence
• Paths for upgrading in order to add future information needs
• Techniques to address evolving security threats

Traditional firewall vs. NGFW

Packet inspection
All data on the internet is broken down into pieces called packets, and these packets have content
that enters a network, which is why all firewalls inspect them. This is called packet filtering. Packet
filtering means that firewalls inspect the source and destination, protocols and ports of each
packet – this basically means where the data comes from, where it is going and how it is getting
there, and the firewalls block or allow entry to the endpoint based on their assessment. Hackers
exploit traditional firewall limitations, and specifically create packets to see how the pattern above
works – the ports, the source, the destination, and so on. This means that hackers inspect the
network traffic at the third and the fourth layer of the OSI model.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Deep packet inspection, intrusion prevention, threat intel
NGFWs perform deep packet inspection (DPI). DPI does everything that normal packet
inspection does, but it also looks deeper in the packet. Where packet inspection looks at the
‘header’, DPI looks at the ‘header’ and the ‘body’ of each packet, looking for malware signatures
and other threats, but it also compares the contents of the packets with the contents of malicious
attacks. They analyse the traffic at the seventh layer. It also gives admins the function to block
applications which they think could be risky. NGFWs have another feature, which is to scan
traffic and to detect when traffic behaviour changes. It does the same thing for protocols, noticing
changes that occur, by comparing to typical protocol use. Because attack patterns are constantly
changing, NGFWs can receive and act on threat intelligence feeds from external sources. A bot
attack may be identified in a completely different network within a different enterprise, and then
this bot attack can be prevented, as the NGFW gets that input and through machine learning
models is able to leverage that information and adapt to it.

SASE – Secure Access Service Edge

Before explaining what SASE is, we will briefly define software-defined-networking, SDN. SDN
is a category of several technologies that allow for the managing of networks through software.
With SDN, administrators can configure networks using software, and it is interoperable, so it is
applicable with any type of hardware, regardless of vendor. In SDN, control and data are
separated onto different planes.
Cloudflare explains this in the following way: “Plane is a networking term that refers to an abstract
conception of where networking processes take place. The control plane refers to networking
processes that direct network traffic, while the data plane is the actual data traversing the network.
The control plane does this by establishing network routes and communicating which protocols
should be used. Think of the control plane as being like the collective group of stoplights that
operate at the intersections of a city. Meanwhile, the data plane is more like the cars that drive on
the roads, stop at the intersections, and obey the stoplights. In networking setups that only use
physical hardware, each individual router or switch has to be configured on its own. The control
plane is closely intertwined with the data plane and with the underlying network hardware. With
SDN, the control plane is separated from the data plane and the actual hardware, making it
possible to configure the control plane from a central location.”

96

Cloudflare explains network topology in the following way: “Network topology is a term that
refers to the way data flows in a network. The control plane establishes and changes network
topology. Again, think of the stoplights that function at the intersections of a city. Network
topology is like the arrangement of the roads and the various destinations in the city, with network
routes being like the roads and computing devices like destinations. Meanwhile, routers and
switches are the stoplights operating at the ‘intersections’ of these routes. Network topology does
not refer to the physical positions of routers, switches, and computers in relation to each other.
Rather, it has to do solely with the paths data takes within the network. If two computers connect
directly to a network switch via Ethernet cables, and Computer A is on the near side of the room
next to the switch while Computer B is on the far side of the room, both computers are
equidistant from the switch in the network topology. In SDN, because the control plane is
separated from the underlying hardware, it is possible to change the network topology via
software instead of hardware. Referring to the example, if an admin using SDN wanted to change
where Computer B was in the network topology, they could use their networking software to
redefine the topology so that traffic went from the switch to (for instance) another router before
going to Computer B.”
Now that we understand SDN, let’s go back to SASE. SASE is a cloud-based model that bundles
SDN with network security. Typically, one single service provider delivers the service. According
to Cloudflare, a SASE approach offers better control and visibility of the network compared to
traditional networking. It offers control and visibility into the users, the traffic and the data
accessing a corporate network. It is flexible and scalable and globally distributed. With SASE,
employees of a corporate network can securely connect to company internal networks and
resources from anywhere, and administrators get good control over data that enters and leaves
the network. SASE has four core components:

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

• Secure web gateways (SWG): The SWG filters threats and breaches by blocking unauthorised
user behaviour and enforcing company security policies. One such example, which Carnegie,
for example, enforces, is that when a user is on the corporate network they cannot access
certain sites. At Carnegie, we can access ChatGPT but access to Google Bard is not allowed
as the latter is able to use the data that the user inputs, which has compliance issues. As such,
a company policy is to block access there.
• Cloud access security broker (CASB): A CASB carries out multiple security operations for
services hosted in the cloud. These operations encompass exposing shadow IT (unauthorised
corporate systems and applications), safeguarding sensitive data using access control and data
loss prevention (DLP) measures, and guaranteeing adherence to data privacy regulations.
• Zero Trust network access (ZTNA): ZTNA platforms secure internal resources from public
visibility and fortify protection against potential data breaches by demanding instantaneous
authentication of each user and device for every safeguarded application.
• Firewall-as-a-service (FWaaS): A FWaaS is delivered from the cloud and is software, unlike a
traditional firewall, which is physical. Instead, the FWaaS has a set of security capabilities,
such as URL filtering, intrusion prevention and policy management across the corporate
network.
There are several benefits to using SASE compared to other models:
• Zero Trust (which we will break down further in a bit) is a key component in SASE. Zero
Trust means that users do not get access to applications and data unless their identity has
been verified. The user may be on the network, but still cannot access data or applications.
Zero Trust and SASE look not only at the identity, but also user location, time of day, and
compliance, and perform an ongoing evaluation of the user during his or her time in the
network. This type of network architecture suits Yubico well. It puts a lot of emphasis on
identity and authentication, which is at the core of what Yubico offers.

• The CASB and the firewall help against DDoS attacks and other points of vulnerability
• Malicious activity can be prevented by filtering URLs, queries and other incoming and
outgoing traffic
• Policies are managed in one place for all locations, all users, devices and apps, all in one
platform
• SASE is effective in routing network traffic, with systems that route network traffic on the
fastest (often the closest) network path. It also considers network congestion – sometimes it
might make sense for data to travel further, if the closest path is congested. At Carnegie, for
example, we have overall good policies for a lot of things. But we have an inferior, compared
to modern standards, way of handling traffic. A Swedish worker in our UK office, for
example, will have her or his traffic originate in the UK, travel to Sweden, and then back to
the UK, instead of using the principle of the closest network path. Our company has adopted
certain parts of SASE, but others remain to be implemented. This does not mean that we will
be hacked – it just means that we have optimisation potential in our networking.

The future of network security is in the cloud

Zscaler, another cybersecurity company focusing on cloud workloads, has a good explanation of
SASE: “Legacy approaches to inspection and verification, such as forwarding traffic through a
multiprotocol label switching (MPLS) service to firewalls in your data centre, are effective if that
is where your users are. Today, though, with so many users working remotely, this ‘hairpinning’
– forwarding remote user traffic to your data centre, inspecting it, and then sending it back again
– tends to reduce productivity and hurt the end-user experience.”

Zero trust security

Zero trust is becoming more and more important in cybersecurity – more and more companies
are adopting it as a policy, and more and more vendors are also pushing their zero trust services.
As we noted in our section on SASE, this type of model is well suited to Yubico. Other
authentication services can be used as well, so it is not unique to Yubico, but it does make a lot
of sense to implement their services in this type of architecture.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

The zero trust model requires strict identity verification for every user and device trying to access
resources on a network, and it treats users the same if they are within the network perimeter, or
if they are accessing it remotely. Traditional networking means that a user is trusted when he or
she is within the network, whereas the zero trust architecture trusts no one. Traditional
networking security is based on what is called the castle-and-moat concept. In castle-and-moat
security, everyone within the network is trusted by default, and for anyone outside the network,
it is hard to access any information. The main issue with such a model is that once an attacker is
in the network, they are free to do whatever they please. Today, it is rare for an enterprise to have
all of their data in just one place. It is usually spread across several locations and clouds, and this
makes it different for bad actors to gain overall control over the entire network.
Zero trust is quite the opposite: by default no one is trusted, regardless of whether they are in the
network or not. It is another layer of security. However, zero trust does not stop there.
Continuous monitoring and validation
Zero trust assumes that potential attackers are in and outside of the networks, so no one, neither
a device nor a user is trusted by default. A login to the network is timed (and timed out), and
needs to be verified again, continuously.
Least privilege
As we see it, there are two main principles for zero trust. One is continuous monitoring and
validation, and the second is least privilege. Least privilege means that users only. For example, it
makes sense for the CEO of a company to have access to plenty of information. But it does not
make sense for them to have access to specific spreadsheets used by other parts of the business,
even though they are the CEO. Least privilege typically starts with highly limited access, and then
more access is added where and when it is required. Having this type of principle requires careful
management of user permissions.

18 September 2023

99

c

Yubico

Device access control
Zero trust also applies to devices, and the least privilege principle applies here as well. In zero
trust, all devices are constantly monitored to ensure they are not compromised. They can also be
timed out to minimise the attack surface.
Micro-segmentation
The practice of micro-segmentation means to break up one zone into several separate zones. A
way to illustrate this is to think of a classic Microsoft Explorer file system. You could have a main
folder, and then separate folders within the main one. Using the equity research example again:
the main folder could be called ‘Research’, and then there could be sub-folders representing
sectors, such as ‘Healthcare’, ‘Tech’, ‘Industrials’. All these files would be stored in one centre,
but the subs would all have separate secure zones. Micro-segmentation means that you can access
the main folder, and you might be able to access ‘Tech’, for example, but your access is restricted
for the others.
Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
Cloudflare states that MFA is another core value of zero trust. MFA requires more than one
factor to authenticate a user, as we have described earlier in this report. A password is not enough,
MFA often requires a password, and that the user is required to enter a one-time code sent to
another device, or confirm a prompt, thus providing several evidence pieces, confirming who
they are. In zero trust, this is where Yubico would be applicable.
Lateral movement
When an attacker enters a network, and then moves within the network, it is called lateral
movement. It is hard to detect, even if the entry point, or the first move, has been detected. The
attacker may have moved further and compromised more of the network. In zero trust, an
attacker is contained so that they cannot move this way, thanks to the features we discuss above.
The network is segmented, connection needs to be re-established and the least privilege principle
is applied. In the castle-and-moat model, containing an attacker is much more difficult.

Identity and access management

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

As we have shown so far, the cybersecurity market is quite large, and we have only scratched the
surface. If we would select a categorisation for Yubico, we would put it in the authentication
market. Authentication is a key component of identity and access management (IAM).
Cloudflare’s description is that “IAM is like the bouncer at the door of a nightclub with a list of
who is allowed in, who isn't allowed in, and who is able to access the VIP area.” It is a way to 1)
tell who the user is, 2) what is the user allowed to see, and 3) what the user is allowed to do.
Technically, IAM means managing digital identities and the privileges that go along with each
identity. It can be formed and structured in many ways – it can be a separate software platform,
it can be an add-on to the EPP, it can be a combination of processes, it can be hardware products
(such as Yubico, although as a component, not a single solution), or a combination of these.
In the context of IAM, an identity is a set of properties that can be measured and recorded in a
smooth way, but also where properties can be conveniently added or removed. The essence is
that computer systems need to be able to verify these identities – while they have certain
properties, the entire identity is not stored. To verify an identity, a system will assess a user for
characteristics specific to that user, known as authentication factors. The three most widely used
factors are:
• Something the user knows/Knowledge
• Something the user has/Possession
• Something the user is/Inherence

100

18 September 2023

c

Yubico

The idea is that ‘secure’ authentication uses two of these three factors, such as a password
(Knowledge) and a one-time-passwords (Possession, the phone). In 2021, the European Union
introduced Strong Customer Authentication (SCA) for banking. SCA is the new European
regulatory requirement to reduce fraud and to make online payments more secure. For online
merchants to accept payments and meet SCA requirements, additional authentication needs to
be built into e.g. a checkout flow. SCA will apply to online payments initiated by customers
throughout Europe. As a result, most card payments will require SCA and all bank transfers will
require them. SCA is also based on the three most widely used factors, described above, but they
are called knowledge (something you know, like a password or a pin), possession (something you
have, such as a phone), inherence (something you are, like your fingerprint). The principle is the
same – to make a secure payment, two of these criteria need to be ticked, such as a password and
a prompt on a phone (two-factor authentication). Same as with the basics of IAM.
The “A”, Access, refers to the data that the user can see and what they can do when the identity
has been established. Imagine that you are working with Equity Sales at Carnegie. You should
have the necessary access for your role, such as trading and information systems. However, you
should not have access things like Equity Research models, which may have information on
potential recommendation changes in the very equities you are broking in your sales role.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Access management is thus the process of controlling, tracking, adding and restricting access or
privileges. Every user in a system has different access and privileges based on individual needs.
Apart from offering the ‘I’ and the ‘A’, a solid IAM company offers a platform that is easily
manoeuvrable. A strategy that is becoming more common in the field of IAM is to always offer
the bare minimum access to all users at all times, and to then gradually allow more access as the
need arises, in order to minimise the threat risks. There is also a Zero Trust theme around identity,
which verifies identity for every user and device, never trusting the device or user. Every request
is monitored individually and throughout the session. We think that IAM is getting more
important with the rise of the cloud, because data and processes are stored in many different
places, rather than in one silo, and the data is accessed from many different locations.
IAM is thus a crucial part in modern internet security. There are many players in this field, with
Microsoft, Okta, Duo and Ping as some of the main vendors. Yubico integrates will all of these
vendors. You could be hacked, but if the IAM is well structured, the hacker may not be able to
access whatever he or she is after. Having a solid IAM structure is however not enough, since a
hacker can work his way further through a corporate network, but nonetheless, it is important.

Okta is one of the world’s leading providers of identity access services. Through its Okta Identity
Platform, the company offers its customers the possibility to grant the right people access to the
right technologies. Customers use the platform in two divergent ways. Okta allows organisations
to use its Workforce Identity Cloud to manage the security of employees, contractors, and
partners. The Workforce Identity Cloud comprises products such as a Universal Directory to
store user and application data, a Single Sign-on module that allows access from any device both
on- and off-premises, and an Adaptive Multi-Factor Authentication service. The second leg of
the Identity Platform, the Okta Customer Identity Cloud allows customers to manage the
identities of their own customers via API tools developed by Okta. The Customer Cloud includes
products such as Universal Login that allows customers to provide consistent login experiences
across applications, Passwordless login that enables users to access their applications without a
password, and a suite of Attack Protection services that protect users from malicious traffic. The
company deploys a Saas-based business model where the primary revenue-source is the multiyear subscription contracts Okta sells connected to its cloud-services. Among its more than
17,000 customers, Okta’s serves large enterprises, smaller businesses, government agencies, and
universities.

Authy/Twilio

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

Part of the Twilio suite since 2015, Authy provides identity and access solutions. Enabled on
both mobile and desktop applications, the service makes use of two-factor authentication (2FA)
technology to ensure that only the right person gets access to the right resources. Authy supports
multiple 2FA methodologies, such as SMS, phone call or a push notification and with its multidevice functionality, the tokens automatically sync up to any new application added to the list of
authorised devices. Looking at revenue model, Authy is free for the end-users to install and use.
For developers however, with an interest in integrating the 2FA solution into their projects, Authy
takes a cut based on the number of successful and completed authentication attempts.
Twilio has confirmed that hackers compromised the accounts of some Authy users as part of a
wider breach of Twilio’s systems. Twilio’s breach in August 2022 saw malicious actors accessing
the data of more than 100 Twilio customers after successfully phishing multiple employees. Media
sources have reported that the attack on Twilio and others were linked to a wider phishing
campaign by a hacking group called 0ktapus, which has stolen close to 10,000 employee
credentials from at least 130 organisations since March 2022. Twilio does not disclose any
financials related to Authy, but we still believe the product is important for investors to have in
mind in relation to the Yubico case.

• Smokescreen, May 2021
• Edgewise, May 2020
• TrustPath, Aug 2018

Founded in 2007, Zscaler is a pioneer within cloud security. The heart in its offering is the Zscaler
Zero Trust Exchange, a cloud-native platform that securely connects users, applications, and
endpoints. According to Zscaler, the Exchange is the world’s largest cloud security platform,
serving more than 6,700 organisations across a wide range of industries. A key aspect of the
platform’s security is the elimination of attack surface. While firewalls provide protective power
to organisations under legacy security approaches, they simultaneously expose them. Instead, the
Zero Trust Exchange makes applications invisible and inaccessible to anyone lacking access
authorisation. Further, by allowing users to be connected directly to applications they use, the
platform solution eliminates legacy backhaul traffic responsible for adding latency.
The platform comprises three core products: Zscaler for Users, which ensures users have fast
and reliable access to the internet and SaaS applications; Zscaler for Workloads, which secures
cloud workloads across multi- and hybrid cloud environments; and Zscaler for IoT/OTT, which
focuses on providing zero trust security for any connected Internet of Things (‘IoT’) and
Operational Technology (‘OT’) devices. By adopting the Zscaler Zero Trust Exchange,
companies eliminate not only the need for on-premises applications, but also the need to balance
between security, cost, and user experience. With users now being spoiled with close to seamless
access to their resources and applications, ensuring uptime and reliability is becoming increasingly
important selling points for businesses.

Darktrace

Darktrace M&A, price ( ) in GBPm
• Cybersprint, Feb 2022 (47.5)

Operating in several different areas of the cybersecurity space, Darktrace is positioned as one of
the global leaders in leveraging AI capabilities to support its customers against threats and
disruptions. The UK-based company says it serves over 8,400 customers as of March 2023. The
core in its service offering is the Cyber AI Platform, underpinned with data collected from the
different resources it serves. The platform comprises three separate components. Next to its
knowledge in AI-based cyber-security, another selling point is the platform’s quick set-up. In
conjunction with its IPO in 2021, Darktrace estimated the average set-up time to amount to no
more than one hour. The company says it generates most of its sales through its direct sales
personnel.
First, its flagship product Immune System provides reinforcing self-learning detection
technology. The system is offered in two variations: Enterprise, an AI detection technology that
protects users across devices, workloads, and cloud containers, and Industrial, which aims to
serve OT-specific cyber security. Second, its Darktrace Antigena focuses on autonomously
responding to cyber-threats targeting networks and email applications. Third, Darktrace’s Cyber
AI Analyst can autonomously provide interpretations on identified security incidents. What the
three key product families have in common is that all three contribute to assisting human cyber
security teams with keeping up with the ever-increasing pressure coming from outside cyber
threats. Darktrace’s protection processes works on the basis that the Immune System works to
detect the threat, and then having the Antigena – and Cyber AI Analyst solutions following to
respond.

Verisign

Moreover, the company is unique in the sense that it is the only registry to operate two out of the
13 internet root servers. In short, a root server is a key component of the DNS, storing a complete
database of domain names and the corresponding IP addresses. As such, these can be seen as the
backbone of internet online access. Verisign’s revenue model is primarily based in the company
recognising revenue from domain name registrations in the .com and .net registries. Moreover,
and while constituting a smaller share, the company also recognises revenue from operating
domain registries for other gTLDs (Generic domains, for example .org) and ccTLDs (Country
code domains, for example .eu).

Founded in 1995, Verisign provides domain name registry services and operates the authoritative
directory for all .com, .cc, .gov, .edu, .name domain names, which in essence is what allows companies
to establish identities online. In addition, the company provides the internet infrastructure
required for companies to communicate with its intended online audience. Less visible however,
compared to its domain name registry business, is Verisign’s role in helping to maintain the
stability of the Domain Name System (DNS) of the internet. In simple terms, the DNS translates
website names (URLs) into numerical addresses (IP) so that the endpoint computer can find the
address and load it into the web browser. Verisign operates a global constellation of DNS servers
providing address information to computers in use – directly enabling the use of internet
applications such as email systems.

Endpoint security
CrowdStrike

One of the largest companies in the cyber-security space, Crowdstrike was founded in 2011 with
an aim to provide cybersecurity to the cloud-era. Today, the company is an industry leader in
Endpoint Protection, which simply put comprises all operations targeted at keeping the actual
devices (desktops, tabs, laptops etc.) safe from invasive threats and attacks. The core in its
offering is the AI-driven CrowdStrike Falcon Platform, through which it offers more than 20
different modules spanning multiple sub-segments of the cybersecurity market, ranging from
vulnerability management services to solutions related to identity protection and corporate
workload security.
The Falcon Platform consists of two components. Firstly, it comprises an agent installed on each
linked endpoint or cloud workload. This link allows CrowdStrike to continuously collect and
transmit data to the second part of the platform, the Security Cloud, providing the company with
an opportunity to recycle fetched data with an aim to re-use across new use-cases. With this setup,
CrowdStrike can leverage the concept of crowdsourcing to feed its AI-driven platform, providing
it with a close to unmatched repository of endpoint security data. The company markets its
products via a subscription-based sales model and in the beginning of 2023 CrowdStrike
reportedly served more than 23,000 subscribing customers according to the company.

Similar to CrowdStrike, SentinelOne offers Endpoint Security services. Through its Singularity
Platform, SentinelOne has gathered endpoint protection, vulnerability management, and incident
response into a single platform. With the centralised platform solution, its customers are able to
access the back-end from all relevant assets in one place. With its machine-learning capabilities
and ability of real-time analysis, the Singularity Platform identify patterns and behaviours that
could lead to invasive threats. In those cases that a threat is detected, the platform can be set up
18 September 2023

to automatically trigger a response; for instance, quarantining the issue and alerting relevant
security personnel. In contrast to CrowdStrike, which relies on a cloud-hosted platform,
SentinelOne supports a hybrid setup that can operate on both endpoints and the cloud.
Another difference can be observed in terms of customers. Sentinel One has a broader customer
base and markets its platform to larger enterprises, smaller businesses as well as government
agencies, whereas CrowdStrike targets larger enterprises and agencies with more complex and
sophisticated cybersecurity needs. In the beginning of 2023, the company reportedly served more
than 10,000 customers in about 80 countries globally on its Singularity Platform. The company
operates on a subscription-based business model where the customer pays recurring fees for
access to the Singularity Platform.

third-party organisations to allow customers to strengthen their security through published APIs
and other dedicated applications.

VMware (Broadcom)

In addition to its core technologies centring on virtualisation technology and hybrid cloud
services, VMware has also developed a security offering covering solutions focusing on endpoint
protection and security analytics. At the core of its security offering, the company offers its cloudnative endpoint and workload platform Carbon Black Cloud. Under the platform, VMware offers
its endpoint security solution Carbon Black Endpoint, the cloud workload protection service
Carbon Black Workload, its Carbon Black Container, which assists companies and security teams
to protect application software that is packaged together with its dependencies, known as
containerised applications. In addition, VMware also markets security infrastructure as
exemplified by the company offering physical firewalls and load balancers. It is important to stress
that security solutions business is only one part of VMware’s offering towards its customers. In
May 2022, Broadcom launched a bid to acquire all of the outstanding shares of VMware, valuing
the company at about USD61bn.

F-Secure

A result of the 2022 demerger between WithSecure and F-Secure, F-Secure is the consumer IT
security business of the old parent company sharing the same name. With a product offering
focusing on endpoint and privacy security, as well as digital identity protection, F-Secure’s
product portfolio is primarily made up of four products: an antivirus security suite called F-Secure
Safe protecting consumer devices, the VPN solution F-Secure Freedom that provides anonymous
and secure internet browsing, the F-Secure ID Protection solution that assists in averting online
identity theft and solutions to simplify login-processes, and lastly F-Secure Sense, a router
software designed to protect against threats directed towards consumers’ internet browsing in
their households. All products are sold independently, however F-Secure also offers the bundled
F-Secure Total, which comprises the Safe, Freedom, and F-Secure ID Protection services.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

F-Secure sells its products through two sales channels where the largest one – the Partner Channel
– made up almost 80% of 2022 sales. Among the partners F-Secure has entered into agreements
with, communication service providers constitute the large chunk of. Aside from the Partner
Channel, the company also markets its offering directly to customers through distinct ecommerce channels including its own online store. In 2022, F-Secure reported revenue of
EUR111m, adj. EBITA of EUR43.9m, which corresponded to an adj. EBITA margin of about
39.6%.

With-Secure

A result of the 2022 demerger between WithSecure and F-Secure, WithSecure is the corporate
IT security business of the old parent company F-Secure. With a business model rooted in its
endpoint protection expertise, the company has broadened its offering in recent years to also
being present in response and detection. Today, WithSecure’s solutions offering can be divided
into a product suite comprising about 70% of sales, and consulting services making up the
remaining 30%.
We view WithSecure’s product portfolio as consisting of three main product segments. Firstly,
its Elements portfolio comprises solutions related to endpoint detection and response, endpoint
protection, cloud protection and vulnerability management. Secondly, it offers cloud content
protection services for platforms like Salesforce and Microsoft Office 365. Lastly, WithSecure
Countercept provides its managed security solutions including response capabilities against
targeted attacks. WithSecure’s consulting services are primarily targeted towards larger customers
and enterprises. Among the services provided, the company performs audits, stress tests, and
overall cyber security management. The service remains project-driven; however, the aim is to
progressively shift to an increased share of continuous agreements with customers. We believe
there is clear synergy potential between the two areas: the knowledge gathered by consultants
from investigating breaches at large companies can be circled back to improve product
development. The company reports that it serves more than 140,000 active customers. In 2022,
F-Secure reported revenue of EUR111m, adj. EBITA of EUR43.9m, which corresponded to an
adj. EBITA margin of about 39.6%.

Risks
Competition
New entrants, or existing cybersecurity vendors may attempt to launch a competing service to
Yubico. This would be especially risky should a major cybersecurity vendor do it, which already
has a significant customer count – such a vendor could be aggressive in cross-selling such a service
to its customers, effectively bypassing Yubico and quickly creating a position in the market.
Technical disruption
As we have noted earlier in this report, the cybersecurity market has undergone rapid change.
There could be a security service launched with the same cryptography as Yubico, and the same
impenetrability as a hardware token, which is software defined, thus making it more user friendly,
thus technically disrupting Yubico. Major security initiatives, such as passkeys, SASE and zero
trust are enablers for YubiKey, we think, but this may change in the future.
What if a Yubico device is hacked?
To our knowledge, a YubiKey has yet to be compromised. We think it is only a question of time
before a YubiKey is compromised, but we think it is impossible for hackers to bypass the
YubiKey security structurally. But if a YubiKey were to be hacked, this may lead to reputational
risk.
Growth lumpiness
There may be lumpiness in growth and/or order bookings between quarters. Q223 was an
example of solid growth, but a decline in order bookings, and this may or may not lead to Q323
revenue being considered as a slowdown. Sometimes Yubico wins major orders, which can
markedly increase revenue growth and EBIT for a specific quarter, but which leads to a slowdown
in order and growth in the following quarters.

For the exclusive use of Theodor Bonnier (theodor.bonnier@fideliocapital.se) at Fidelio Capital

FX
Most of Yubico’s sales are in USD followed by the EUR, making it sensitive to fluctuations in
FX rates.
User behaviour
We think that YubiKeys are among the safest authentication tools out there. By design, the
authentication is tied to hardware, which requires users to have one more device at hand for
authentication purposes. Users might think this is tedious, or software alternatives may catch up
to be ‘safe enough’, triggering user behaviour to change.
Third party reliance
Yubico relies on third parties for its sales, and we expect that figure to be around 10%. Disruption,
or issues with its partners could adversely impact its revenue.
Entering new markets
Yubico is well known in the US market, but we think that it will push to penetrate the European
market, and other markets as well. This is associated with costs and may not be successful.
Supply chain
Yubico is highly reliant on third parties for its manufacturing. Disruption across its manufacturing
partners or component vendors may adversely impact its revenue.

Sustainability
Sustainability as a business driver
Yubico’s vision is to ensure safe internet login procedures for everyone. IT security is critical to
ensure the safety of the user, the population, medical patients, clients, and by extension,
democracies themselves. Yubico supports resilient infrastructure, effective, accountable, and
transparent institutions, and public access to information. Yubico therefore responds to the
United Nations Sustainable Development Goals, article 9 and 16. The company benefits from
customers demanding increased IT security and safer login solutions. Yubico works to ensure a
safe, cost-efficient manufacturing process and its products are designed to have a long lifespan.
Recycled materials are used in all packaging, and sourcing of materials is done through
environmentally responsible suppliers.
Sustainability targets and achievements
The overall objective of Yubico’s sustainability focus is related to its value chain and materiality
analysis. Performed in 2021, the materiality analysis identified areas where Yubico has the biggest
impact on the environment, society, and the economy. These areas can be divided in to six
categories: minimising environmental impact, securing free speech, democracy and human rights,
supporting diversity, protecting critical IT infrastructure, and ensuring high ethical standards.
Yubico’s company values centre on supporting diversity, inclusion, and a healthy work
environment. The team is global, with more than 30 nationalities. Some 29% of the employees
are women, a figure that Yubico is actively working to increase, especially in the technical and
sales areas of the company, for example by supporting the Women in Cybersecurity organisation
(WiCys). Yubico donates its YubiKey product to journalists, non-profit organisations and other
organisations working to protect human rights to ensure information safety.

Sustainability risks and past incidents
Yubico faces a risk that suppliers might not be fully committed to sustainability work. The
company faces the risk that its products will not provide protection against security vulnerabilities,
exploits, or cyber-attacks. Malfunctioning of Yubico’s product can be related to internal factors,
for example by misconfiguration, as well as external factors, for example defects in the sourced
materials. If such weaknesses occur, they may erode the protective features of Yubico’s products.
So far, no customers have suffered from misuse of Yubico’s products.

Background to the Yubico transaction
ACQ Bure is a special purpose acquisition company (SPAC) founded by the listed investment
company Bure Equity in March 2021. On 19 April 2023 ACQ announced the intention to acquire
Yubico for USD800m, which corresponds to SEK8,293m. The acquisition price consists of 42%
cash and 58% of newly issued shares in ACQ.
After the transaction is completed, ACQ Bure will transform into Yubico with financial reporting
in accordance with Yubico’s financial history. This will be possible as the transaction is a reverse
acquisition and therefore does not create any goodwill.

This transaction is a special situation for Bure Equity, as the company owns shares in both ACQ
Bure and directly in Yubico, but it seems to us that the company was mindful about this dual
interest and handled the decisions and processes in a good way. Bure will own about 17.4% of
Yubico after the deal is completed. We would also note that Bure also holds 4.2m sponsor
warrants in the combined company which can be exercised between 1 April 2026 and 1 April
2031. The warrants have a subscription price of SEK130 and mean a potential dilution of 12%
or about 4.8% after the new share issue. The board of directors in the new company (Yubico)
can also decide to only issue shares corresponding to the net amount, i.e. the difference between
the share price and the subscription price, and thereby reduce the dilutive effect and cash
injection.

Shareholders representing 74,147 shares and votes in ACQ voted against the proposal to approve
the merger at the EGM on 20 June 2023. This means that there was an essentially irrelevant
redemption of about 0.2% of the number of shares in ACQ Bure, compared with a maximum
redemption of 10%. We have therefore not yet adjusted for this in our model.
Yubico has announced the intention to launch a long-term incentive program (LTI 2023) and
award performance stock units (PSU) shortly after publication of the Q3(23) report, which is
scheduled to be published on 10 November 2023. The maximum number of PSUs that could be
awarded is 700,000, which would be a dilution of about 0.8% for current shareholders.

Disclosures and disclaimers
Carnegie Investment Bank AB

Carnegie Investment Bank AB (publ.) is a leading investment bank with a Nordic focus. The Carnegie group of companies, together "Carnegie", generates added value for institutions, companies and private clients in the
areas of trade in securities, investment banking and private banking. Carnegie has approximately 600 employees, located in offices in six countries.

Ratings and risk assessment structure

Current rating system as of October 2011
Buy (B), upside of at least 10% to the target price and with an attractive risk/reward profile
Hold (H), neutral risk/reward profile or the stock is trading relatively near its target price
Sell (S), unattractive risk/reward profile and the stock is trading above its target price
Not rated (NR), Under review (UR), Under bid (UB). The investment rating, if any, has been suspended
temporarily.
Ratings may from time to time deviate from the definitions above owing to market volatility. Any such deviation
will be assessed regularly to determine whether it should no longer be considered temporary.
Risk assessment
The risk assessment is based on the analyst’s evaluation of the company’s equity beta based on the business risk
(asset beta) and financial risk (gearing).
Low risk estimated equity beta <0.75
Medium risk estimated equity beta 0.75 to 1.25
High risk estimated equity beta >1.25

Valuation, methodology, and assumptions
Target price
Carnegie publishes a target price for most of the stocks in our Research Universe. The target price is the analyst's
assessment of expected total return over the coming six to 12 months based on various fundamental valuation
methods. A commonly used method is DCF valuation, where future cash flows are discounted to today. Analysts
may also use different valuation multiples, e.g. P/E ratio and EV/EBIT multiples, relative to industry peers to obtain
a target price. For companies where it is appropriate, a target price can also be based on the analyst’s assessment
of a fair ratio relative to the net asset value of the company. Target prices are revised when earnings and cash
flow forecasts are changed. Thus, changes to estimates are a key risk to the target price. Other reasons for revising
target prices include changes in the underlying value of a company’s assets and when factors affecting the required
rate of return change, which can also be seen as risk factors to the target price.
Information
You will find detailed information about the valuation or methodology, the underlying assumptions and risks on
Carnegie Edge (www.carnegie-edge.com). The complete history of research reports and previous
recommendations can also be found on Carnegie Edge.

Company description

Company miscellaneous

Founded in 2007, Yubico is a Swedish cybersecurity company whose core
offering centres on its multi-factor authentication hardware device: the YubiKey.
The key requires the user to combine a security key with either a PIN or a
biometric security component, adding another layer of complexity to the twofactor authentication solution. More than 22m units of the YubiKey have been
sold in more than 160 countries around the globe. So far, it has had zero
identified successful hacking attempts, according to the company. Yubico has a
large and impressive list of customers that includes 19 of the world’s 20 largest
tech companies, with its cybersecurity solution trusted by names such as Google,
Amazon, Microsoft and Salesforce. Since 2020, Yubico has also offered a
subscription service for YubiKeys, though this remains a small part of total
revenue. The company has its HQ in Stockholm and Santa Clara, California.
